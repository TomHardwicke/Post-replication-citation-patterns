Cleaning was found to affect negative, neutral, and mildly positive states. We extend this influence to success, a self-serving state. We manipulated success vs. failure and measured changes in optimism (Experiment 1) or self-esteem (Experiment 2). Moreover, we examined boundary conditions for the clean-slate effect. Experiment 1 indicates that the influence of performance on optimism diminishes if participants knew (compared to did not know) they were cleaning their hands. Experiment 2 indicates that the influence of performance on self-esteem diminishes if participants cleaned themselves (compared to an object). These results suggest that the clean-slate effect requires both awareness and self-reference of the cleaning act. Thus, the clean-slate effect seems to depend on both conscious inferences and automatic processes. A meta-analysis across the experiments confirms a moderate-sized clean-slate effect.","[Koerner, Anita; Strack, Fritz] Univ Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany","Korner, A (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Rontgenring 10, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",anita.koerner@uni-wuerzburg.de,NA,"Korner, Anita/0000-0003-3761-2118",NA,NA,NA,61,0,0,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-4545,1940-1183,NA,J SOC PSYCHOL,J.

For example, traditional theories cannot account for refusals to cooperate if cooperation would result in higher payoffs. A prominent illustration are responders' rejections of positive but unequal payoffs in the Ultimatum Game. To accommodate this anomaly in a rational framework one needs to assume both a preference for higher payoffs and a preference for equal payoffs. The current set of studies shows that the relative weight of these preference components depends on external conditions and that consumption priming may decrease responders' rejections of unequal payoffs. Specifically, we demonstrate that increasing the accessibility of consumption-related information accentuates the preference for higher payoffs. Furthermore, consumption priming increased responders' reaction times for unequal payoffs which suggests an increased conflict between both preference components. While these results may also be integrated into existing social preference models, we try to identify some basic psychological processes underlying economic decision making. Going beyond the Ultimatum Game, we propose that a distinction between comparative and deductive evaluations may provide a more general framework to account for various anomalies in behavioral economics.","[Zuern, Michael] Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol Social & Econ Cognit 2, Cologne, Germany; [Strack, Fritz] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Wurzburg, Germany","Zurn, M (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol Social & Econ Cognit 2, Cologne, Germany.",michael.zuern@uni-koeln.de,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,48,0,0,1,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,NA,NA,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Both open-minded and caring are generally seen as positive attributes. However, consistency varies-the attribute caring is consistent with the midwife stereotype while open-minded is not. In general, both stimulus valence and consistency can influence evaluations. Six experiments investigated the respective influence of valence and consistency on evaluative judgments in the domain of stereotyping. In an impression formation paradigm, valence and consistency of stereotypic information about target persons were manipulated orthogonally and spontaneous evaluations of these target persons were measured. Valence reliably influenced evaluations. However, for strongly valenced stereotypes, no effect of consistency was observed. Parameters possibly preventing the occurrence of consistency effects were ruled out, specifically, valence of inconsistent attributes, processing priority of category information, and impression formation instructions. However, consistency had subtle effects on evaluative judgments if the information about a target person was not strongly valenced and experimental conditions were optimal. Concluding, in principle, both stereotype valence and consistency can play a role in evaluative judgments of stereotypic target persons. However, the more subtle influence of consistency does not seem to substantially influence evaluations of stereotyped target persons. Implications for fluency research and stereotype disconfirmation are discussed.","[Schubert, Lisa; Koerner, Anita; Strack, Fritz] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Psychol, Wurzburg, Germany; [Lindau, Berit; Topolinski, Sascha] Univ Cologne, Social Cognit Ctr Cologne, Cologne, Germany","Schubert, L (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Psychol, Wurzburg, Germany.",lisa.schubert@uni-wuerzburg.de,NA,"Schubert, Lisa/0000-0001-9735-8786; Korner, Anita/0000-0003-3761-2118",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Str 264/25-1]; German Federal State Government of North-Rhine Westphalia (Nachwuchsforschun gsgruppe) [NRW 005-1503-0007],This research was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (Str 264/25-1) and by German Federal State Government of North-Rhine Westphalia (Nachwuchsforschun gsgruppe.

As a consequence, this information will be more likely to become the basis for the absolute judgment which will therefore be assimilated toward the anchor. However, if the activated information overlaps with information that is elicited by the absolute judgment itself, the preceding comparative judgment should not exert an incremental effect and should fail to result in an anchoring effect. The present studies find this result when the comparative judgment refers to a general category and the absolute judgment refers to a subset of the general category that was activated by the anchor value. For example, participants comparing the average annual temperature in New York City to a high 102 degrees F judged the average winter, but not summer temperature to be higher than participants making no comparison. On the other hand, participants comparing the annual temperature to a low -4 degrees F judged the average summer, but not winter temperature to be lower than control participants.

Surprising stimuli are schema discrepant and thus entail cognitive disfluency, which elicits immediate negative affect. This affect in turn works like a phasic cognitive tuning switching the current processing mode from more automatic and heuristic to more systematic and reflective processing. Directly testing the initial elicitation of negative affect by surprising events, the present experiment presented high and low surprising neutral trivia statements to N = 28 participants while assessing their spontaneous facial expressions via facial electromyography.

These critiques as well as failures to replicate several high-profile studies have been used as justification to proclaim a replication crisis in psychology. Psychologists are encouraged to conduct more exact replications of published studies to assess the reproducibility of psychological research. This article argues that the alleged crisis of replicability is primarily due to an epistemological misunderstanding that emphasizes the phenomenon instead of its underlying mechanisms. As a consequence, a replicated phenomenon may not serve as a rigorous test of a theoretical hypothesis because identical operationalizations of variables in studies conducted at different times and with different subject populations might test different theoretical constructs. Therefore, we propose that for meaningful replications, attempts at reinstating the original circumstances are not sufficient. Instead, replicators must ascertain that conditions are realized that reflect the theoretical variable(s) manipulated (and/or measured) in the original study.","[Stroebe, Wolfgang] Univ Utrecht, Dept Psychol, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Stroebe, Wolfgang] Univ Groningen, Dept Social & Org Psychol, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Strack, Fritz] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Wurzburg, Germany","Stroebe, W (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Psychol, POB 80140, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",w.stroebe@uu.nl,NA,"Stroebe, Wolfgang/0000-0003-2767-2838",NA,NA,NA,78,237,239,6,137,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1745-6916,1745-6924,NA,PERSPECT PSYCHOL SCI,Perspect.

According to the motivational priming theory, pain should facilitate the processing of unpleasant and hamper the processing of pleasant affective stimuli. To this end, we investigated the influence of tonic pain on the processing of happy and angry faces in 30 healthy participants. As a measure of affect processing, the interference of picture content on participants' voluntary reactions to the pictures either with a compatible or an incompatible facial muscle (M. zygomaticus major [smile] or M. corrugator supercilii [frown]) was recorded by electromyogram (EMG). Additionally, participants rated valence and arousal of each picture. During both tasks, the participants received either painful or non-painful pressure stimulation. Pain stimulation was generally associated with slower compatible and incompatible muscle responses (M. zygomaticus and M. corrugator) and fewer erroneous incompatible (M. corrugator) responses to happy faces. However, pain did not affect muscle responses to angry faces and explicit valence and arousal ratings. Thus, pain seems to selectively influence the responses to happy faces, which may result from a slowed processing of incongruent information (happy/pain). That happy faces are processed differently during pain may bear important implications for social interactions during acute and possibly even chronic pain states.

Their activation influences cognitive and perceptive processes: Previous work suggests that an approach orientation instigates a focus on larger units as compared to avoidance. Study 1 confirms this assumption using a paradigm that more directly taps a person's tendency to represent objects as belonging to small or large units than prior studies. It was further predicted that the self should also be represented as belonging to larger units, and hence be more interdependent under approach than under avoidance. Study 2 supports this prediction. As a consequence of this focus on belonging to larger units, it was finally predicted that approach results in a stronger identification with one's in-group than avoidance.

A global processing style, in turn, is assumed to instigate a focus on similarities whereas a local processing style is assumed to instigate a focus on differences. Integrating these two ideas, the present research examines the hypothesis that participants under approach perceive objects as more similar to each other than participants under avoidance. To test this assumption, we induced the two motivational orientations and elicited judgments of similarities (Experiments 1 and 2) and differences (Experiment 2) for pairs of pictures. Results confirmed the hypothesis. We propose that the relative attunement to similarities/differences under approach/avoidance is functional because it allows for a flexible conceptualization of the environment/an ability to discern slight deviations from what is expected.

That is, why do people yield to immediate short-term temptations even though they know that it will be detrimental to the pursuit of their long-term goals? Modern psychology has tackled the self-control problem from a variety of perspectives, such as cybernetic models, models of inter-temporal choice, goal-intention models, goal-conflict models, and dual-system models. One advantage of dual-system models seems to be that these models explicitly integrate impulsive processes of behavior determination into their theoretical architecture. We report a program of empirical research which has emanated from a dual-system approach and discuss the benefits and limitations of such an approach for basic and applied research.","[Hofmann, Wilhelm] Univ Wurzburg, LS Psychol 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Hofmann, W (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, LS Psychol 2, Rontgenring 10, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",hofmannw@psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Friese, Malte/A-3788-2016","Friese, Malte/0000-0003-0055-513X",NA,NA,NA,162,8,8,2,20,HOGREFE & HUBER PUBLISHERS,GOTTINGEN,"MERKELSTR 3, D-37085 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY",0033-3042,2190-6238,NA,PSYCHOL RUNDSCH,Psychol.

Design and participants Forty-two hazardous drinkers were assigned randomly to a condition in which they were implicitly trained to avoid or to approach alcohol, using a training variety of the alcohol Approach Avoidance Test (AAT). Participants pushed or pulled a joystick in response to picture-format (landscape or portrait). The pictures depicted alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks. Participants in the avoid-alcohol condition pushed most alcoholic and pulled most non-alcoholic drinks. For participants in the approach-alcohol condition these contingencies were reversed. After the implicit training, participants performed a taste test, including beers and soft drinks. Automatic action tendencies at post-test were assessed with the AAT, including both trained and untrained pictures, and with a different test (Implicit Association Test, IAT). We further tested effects on subjective craving. Results Action tendencies for alcohol changed in accordance with training condition, with the largest effects in the clinically relevant avoid-alcohol condition. These effects occurred outside subjective awareness and generalized to new pictures in the AAT and to an entirely different test using words, rather than pictures (IAT). In relatively heavy drinking participants who demonstrated changed action tendencies in accordance with their training condition, effects were found on drinking behaviour, with participants in the approach-alcohol condition drinking more alcohol than participants in the avoid-alcohol condition.

These intuitions are driven by increased fluency in processing coherent triads compared to incoherent triads, which in turn triggers a brief and short positive affect. The present work investigates which of these internal cues, fluency or positive affect, is the actual cue underlying coherence intuitions. In Experiment 1, participants liked coherent word triads more than incoherent triads, but did not rate them as being more fluent in processing. In Experiment 2, participants could intuitively detect coherence when they misattributed fluency to an external source, but lost this intuitive ability when they misattributed affect. It is concluded that the coherence-induced fluency by itself is not consciously experienced and not used in the coherence intuitions, but the fluency-triggered affective consequences.

In line with this account, it was shown that coherent triads (a) are processed faster than incoherent triads (Study 1), (b) serve as positive affective primes (Study 2), and (c) are liked more than incoherent triads (Study 3). When participants were provided with an irrelevant source of their affective reactions, they lost the ability to intuitively discriminate between coherent and incoherent triads (Study 4).

However, if the distractor item is not judged as particularly memorable, alternative inferential strategies will be used, and with less confidence.

According to these rules, contributions to a communication should be informative, relevant, true, and unambiguous. It is assumed that subjects determine the pragmatic meaning of instructions and questions on the basis of these rules and the provided context. In contrast to most natural settings, standardized experimental procedures rarely allow for an interactive determination of pragmatic meaning and often preclude feedback as a corrective device. As a consequence, subjects are required to rely heavily on general rules, and even subtle cues may become informationally loaded. The information extracted from context cues may often not be intended by the experimenter. Thus subjects may infer more than they are supposed to, resulting in discrepancies between the experimenter's intended and subjects' inferred meaning of the instructions. If researchers are not sensitive to the information provided by verbal and non-verbal context cues, their interpretation of research results may be based on biased data. Evidence from different research domains is reported to support the presented assumptions and their implications for bias avoiding strategies are discussed.","UNIV MANNHEIM, W-6800 MANNHEIM, GERMANY; UNIV TRIER, W-5500 TRIER, GERMANY; ZUMA, MANNHEIM, GERMANY",NA,NA,"Schwarz, Norbert/B-3591-2008","Schwarz, Norbert/0000-0002-8868-7067",NA,NA,NA,58,60,60,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-2772,1099-0992,NA,EUR J SOC PSYCHOL,Eur.

Subjects read a story to which either understanding or anger was a possible reaction. While reading the story, all subjects were induced to hold their faces in expressions of either happiness or anger In addition, one group of subjects engaged in 2 min of vigorous exercise immediately before reading the story. Another group engaged in the exercise 90 s before reading the story. The control group read the story without having exercised. Non-aroused subjects tended to report more favorable reactions when smiling than when holding an angry expression. This difference was significant when there was a delay between the exercise and the rating task and was reduced to nonsignificance when there was no delay. These results are discussed in the context of a theory of private self-perception in which people use their bodily sensations as information when making judgments.","MAX PLANCK INST PSYCHOL RES,MUNICH,GERMANY","MARTIN, LL (corresponding author), UNIV GEORGIA,DEPT PSYCHOL,ATHENS,GA 30602, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25,37,37,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320",0146-1672,NA,NA,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

Competing hypotheses about mood influences on this correction process were tested in a laboratory experiment. While some models (e.g., Ellis & Ashbrook, 1988) predict a general reduction of capacity due to affect, another approach (Schwarz, 1990) suggests an informative function of mood which has an impact on processing style. Accordingly, good mood triggers a simplifying way of information processing, while bad mood evokes detail-oriented processing. Results of a 3 (mood: positive, negative, neutral)X2 (target behaviour: happy, sad)X2 (situation: congruent, incongruent) experiment show that, for judgments about the target person's temperament, only observers in a neutral mood took into account situational information, while those in either a good or a bad mood did not. For judgments about the target's social attractiveness, however, which were more self-relevant, it was shown that observers in a bad mood did consider situational information, while those in either a good or a neutral mood did not. As no differences in recall were obtained, it is concluded that situational information is available independent of mood. If it enters into the judgment process, however, is determined by the personal relevance of the judgment and the informative function of the affective state.","UNIV TRIER, W-5500 TRIER, GERMANY; ZENTRUM UMFRAGEN METHODEN & ANALYSEN EV, MANNHEIM, GERMANY","BOHNER, G (corresponding author), UNIV MANNHEIM, FP SUBJEK ERFAHRUNG, STEUBENSTR 46, W-6800 MANNHEIM, GERMANY.",NA,"Schwarz, Norbert/B-3591-2008; Bohner, Gerd/B-2274-2008","Schwarz, Norbert/0000-0002-8868-7067; Bohner, Gerd/0000-0002-0564-3625",NA,NA,NA,34,1,1,0,1,VERLAG HANS HUBER,BERN 9,"LANGGASS-STRASSE 76, CH-3000 BERN 9, SWITZERLAND",0044-3514,NA,NA,Z SOZIALPSYCHOL,Z.
