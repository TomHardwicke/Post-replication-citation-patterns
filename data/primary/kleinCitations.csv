I argue that, currently, such meta-hypotheses are typically left unstated except in methodological papers and that the consequence of this practice is that it is hard to determine what can be learned from a direct replication study. I argue in favor of a procedure dubbed the ""limited homogeneity assumption"" - assuming very little heterogeneity of effect sizes when a literature is initiated but switching to an assumption of heterogeneity once an initial finding has been successfully replicated in a direct replication study. Until that has happened, we do not allow the literature to proceed to a mature stage. This procedure will elevate the scientific status of direct replication studies in science. Following this procedure, a well-designed direct replication study is a means of falsifying an overall claim in an early phase of a literature and thus sets up a hurdle against the canonization of false facts in the behavioral sciences.",,"[Stromland, Eirik] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, PO 7802, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Stromland, Eirik] Western Norway Univ Appl Sci, Dept Business Adm, PO 7802, N-5020 Bergen, Norway",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,History & Philosophy Of Science,WOS:000632377200001,

While researchers have worked to discuss possible problems and solutions, work has yet to uncover how this new culture may have altered reporting practices in the social sciences. As outliers and other errant data points can bias both descriptive and inferential statistics, the search for these data points is essential to any analysis using these parameters. We quantified the rates of reporting of outliers and other data within psychology at two time points: 2012 when the replication crisis was born, and 2017, after the publication of reports concerning replication, questionable research practices, and transparency. A total of 2235 experiments were identified and analyzed, finding an increase in reporting from only 15.7% of experiments in 2012 to 25.0% in 2017. We investigated differences across years given the psychological field or statistical analysis that experiment employed. Further, we inspected whether data exclusions mentioned were whole participant observations or data points, and what reasons authors gave for stating the observation was deviant.

Instead of telling researchers what they want to know, statisticians should teach researchers which questions they can ask. In some situations, the answer to the question they are most interested in will be the p value. As long as null-hypothesis tests have been criticized, researchers have suggested including minimum-effect tests and equivalence tests in our statistical toolbox, and these tests have the potential to greatly improve the questions researchers ask. If anyone believes p values affect the quality of scientific research, preventing the misinterpretation of p values by developing better evidence-based education and user-centered statistical software should be a top priority.

In this view, both approaches attempt to construct abstract representations of empirical relational structures. Whereas quantitative research uses variable-based models that abstract from individual cases, qualitative research favors case-based models that abstract from individual characteristics. Variable-based models are usually stated in the form of quantified sentences (scientific laws). This syntactic structure implies that sentences about individual cases are derived using deductive reasoning. In contrast, case-based models are usually stated using context-dependent existential sentences (qualitative statements). This syntactic structure implies that sentences about other cases are justifiable by inductive reasoning. We apply this representationalist perspective to the problems of generalization and replication. Using the analytical framework of modal logic, we argue that the modes of reasoning are often not only applied to the context that has been studied empirically, but also on a between-contexts level. Consequently, quantitative researchers mostly adhere to a top-down strategy of generalization, whereas qualitative researchers usually follow a bottom-up strategy of generalization. Depending on which strategy is employed, the role of replication attempts is very different. In deductive reasoning, replication attempts serve as empirical tests of the underlying theory. Therefore, failed replications imply a faulty theory. From an inductive perspective, however, replication attempts serve to explore the scope of the theory. Consequently, failed replications do not question the theory per se, but help to shape its boundary conditions. We conclude that quantitative research may benefit from a bottom-up generalization strategy as it is employed in most qualitative research programs. Inductive reasoning forces us to think about the boundary conditions of our theories and provides a framework for generalization beyond statistical testing. In this perspective, failed replications are just as informative as successful replications, because they help to explore the scope of our theories.",,"[Borgstede, Matthias; Scholz, Marcel] Univ Bamberg, Fdn Educ, Bamberg, Germany; [Borgstede, Matthias] Univ Bamberg, Fdn Educ, Bamberg, Germany",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000619455700001,

We examine whether auditors' assessments of the quality of client explanations and their decision to follow-up with the client are influenced by (1) communication modes that vary in media richness, and (2) a prime that is intended to stimulate skeptical behavior. Media richness refers to the amount of data inherent in the communication mode. We predict that richer communication modes, such as video, can be more distracting than less rich communication modes, such as email. More distracted auditors will assess the quality of the client's response as higher and are less likely to follow-up with the client-potentially impairing audit quality and increasing audit risk.

At the same time, these programs have noted that the proper way to analyze replication studies is far from a settled matter and have analyzed their data in several different ways. This presents 2 challenges to interpreting the results of these programs. First, different analysis methods assess different operational definitions of replication. Second, the properties of these methods are not necessarily common knowledge; it is possible for a successful replication to be deemed a failure by nearly all of the metrics used, and it is not always immediately clear how likely such errors are to occur. In this article, we describe the methods commonly used in replication research and how they imply specific operational definitions of replication. We then compute the probability of false failure (i.e., a successful replication is concluded to have failed) and false success determinations. These are shown to be high (often over 50%) and in many cases uncontrolled. We then demonstrate that errors are probable in the data to which these methods have been applied in the literature. We show that the probability that some reported conclusions about replication are incorrect can be as high as 75-80%.

When the judge simply admonished jurors to disregard the evidence, participants in the female judge condition were more likely to rate the defendant as guilty compared to the male judge condition, suggesting the former considered the inadmissible evidence more. However, this pattern was reversed when, in addition to the disregard instruction, an collaborative explanation for why one should disregard the evidence was provided: specifically, participants in the female judge condition rated the defendant as less guilty than those in the male judge condition.

I suggest that in many areas of psychology aiming at replication is misplaced and that instead replication attempts are better seen as exploratory studies that can be used in the cumulative development of theory and measurement procedures.",,"[Irvine, Elizabeth] Cardiff Univ, Sch English Commun & Philosophy, Cardiff, Wales; [Irvine, Elizabeth] Cardiff Univ, Sch English Commun & Philosophy, Cardiff, Wales",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000611010000001,

Here we argue that unexplained heterogeneity reflects a lack of coherence between the concepts applied and data observed and therefore a lack of understanding of the subject matter. Typical levels of heterogeneity thus offer a useful but neglected perspective on the levels of understanding achieved in psychological science. Focusing on continuous outcome variables, we surveyed heterogeneity in 150 meta-analyses from cognitive, organizational, and social psychology and 57 multiple close replications. Heterogeneity proved to be very high in meta-analyses, with powerful moderators being conspicuously absent. Population effects in the average meta-analysis vary from small to very large for reasons that are typically not understood. In contrast, heterogeneity was moderate in close replications. A newly identified relationship between heterogeneity and effect size allowed us to make predictions about expected heterogeneity levels. We discuss important implications for the formulation and evaluation of theories in psychology. On the basis of insights from the history and philosophy of science, we argue that the reduction of heterogeneity is important for progress in psychology and its practical applications, and we suggest changes to our collective research practice toward this end.",,"[Linden, Audrey Helen; Honekopp, Johannes] Northumbria Univ, Dept Psychol, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Honekopp, Johannes] Northumbria Univ, Dept Psychol, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000609696600001,

The purpose of this article is to contribute to an epistemological dialogue on the value of preregistration in consumer research by identifying the limitations, drawbacks, and potential adverse effects of a preregistration system. After a brief review of some of the implementation challenges that commonly arise with preregistration, we raise three levels of issues with a system of preregistration. First, we identify its limitations as a means of advancing consumer knowledge, thus questioning the sufficiency of preregistration in promoting good consumer science. Second, we elaborate on why consumer science can progress even in the absence of preregistration, thereby also questioning the necessity of preregistration in promoting good consumer science. Third, we discuss serious potential adverse effects of preregistration, both at the individual researcher level and at the level of the field as a whole. We conclude by offering a broader perspective on the narrower role that preregistration can play within the general pursuit of building robust and useful knowledge about consumers.",,"[Pham, Michel Tuan] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Oh, Travis Tae] Yeshiva Univ, New York, NY 10033 USA; [Pham, Michel Tuan] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA",,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,"Business; Psychology, Applied",WOS:000618078000013,

The first group was instructed about the precise CS-US contingency before conditioning. The second group was instructed to discover the CS-US contingency. The third group did not receive any contingency instructions.

When actually experiencing (or predicting affective states for) only one of these options, people are usually in single evaluation (SE) mode where direct comparisons are more difficult. This situational difference in evaluation mode was observed to lead to overpredictions of positive affect (happiness) when people were in JE in comparison to SE for options that were quantitatively different, but there were no overpredictions for options that were qualitatively different. This effect was coined distinction bias. In the present paper, we replicated (and extended on) Studies 1 and 2 from Hsee and Zhang with 824 MTurk participants. In Study 1 we replicated the original findings: Relative to people in SE, people in JE overpredicted the happiness derived from quantitatively different hypothetical scenarios (i.e., selling 80 vs 160 books, or 160 vs 240 books), but did not overpredict the difference between qualitatively different hypothetical scenarios (i.e., selling 0 books vs 80 books; 0 being the implicit reference point that makes the two scenarios qualitatively different).

For many researchers, issues of confidence may be partially resolved by relying on replications. Here, we bring further evidence that the classical logic of confirmation, according to which the result of a replication study confirms the original finding when it reaches statistical significance, could be usefully abandoned. With real examples taken from the infant literature and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that a very wide range of possible replication results would in a formal statistical sense constitute confirmation as they can be explained simply due to sampling error. Thus, often no useful conclusion can be derived from a single or small number of replication studies. We suggest that, in order to accumulate and generate new knowledge, the dichotomous view of replication as confirmatory/disconfirmatory can be replaced by an approach that emphasizes the estimation of effect sizes via meta-analysis.

The discrepancy between their current performance and their goal determines task (dis)satisfaction, and thus whether they will make greater effort. We propose and test a theoretical extension of goal-setting theory, namely that different types of goal standards (minimal or maximal) fundamentally change this monitoring process. Through four experiments we demonstrate that with maximal goals (""ideal"" standards), individuals experience greater task satisfaction the nearer their current performance comes to the goal.

In other words, replication efforts should seek not just to support or question the original findings, but also to replace them with revised, stronger theories with greater explanatory power. Achieving this will typically require adding new measures, conditions, and subject populations to research designs, in order to carry out conceptual tests of multiple theories in addition to directly replicating the original findings. To illustrate the value of the creative destruction approach for theory pruning in organizational scholarship, we describe recent replication initiatives re-examining culture and work morality, working parents' reasoning about day care options, and gender discrimination in hiring decisions. Significance statement: It is becoming increasingly clear that many, if not most, published research findings across scientific fields are not readily replicable when the same method is repeated. Although extremely valuable, failed replications risk leaving a theoretical void-reducing confidence the original theoretical prediction is true, but not replacing it with positive evidence in favor of an alternative theory. We introduce the creative destruction approach to replication, which combines theory pruning methods from the field of management with emerging best practices from the open science movement, with the aim of making replications as generative as possible. In effect, we advocate for a Replication 2.0 movement in which the goal shifts from checking on the reliability of past findings to actively engaging in competitive theory testing and theory building.

Sport and exercise medicine (SEM) research is vulnerable to the same QRPs that pervade the biomedical and psychological sciences, producing false-positive results and inflated effect sizes. Approximately 90% of biomedical research reports supported study hypotheses, provoking suspicion about the field-wide presence of systematic biases to facilitate study findings that confirm researchers' expectations. In this education review, we introduce three common QRPs (ie, HARKing, P-hacking and Cherry-picking), perform a cross-sectional study to assess the proportion of original SEM research that reports supported study hypotheses, and draw attention to existing solutions and resources to overcome QRPs that manifest in exploratory research. We hypothesised that >= 85% of original SEM research studies would report supported study hypotheses. Two independent assessors systematically identified, screened, included, and extracted study data from original research articles published between 1 January 2019 and 31 May 2019 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, Sports Medicine, the American Journal of Sports Medicine, and the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy. We extracted data relating to whether studies reported that the primary hypothesis was supported or rejected by the results.

However, debate continues regarding the state of asymmetry induced by unilateral contractions. We have previously found a bilateral enhancement of alpha amplitude that occurs after contractions, reflecting cortical downregulation instead of changes in asymmetric activity. To corroborate our observations, we examined the effects of 45 s of unilateral dynamic handgrip contractions on subsequent resting alpha activity. Twenty-two right-handed participants were recruited (M = 25 years, 17 female). The study used a within-subjects design consisting of a pre and post-test (2 min resting; eyes open) for the intervention (dynamic handgrip; at a self-determined pace of approximately twice a second for 45 s for each hand). Following the handgrip task, an increase in alpha amplitude above the baseline was observed over the entire cortex, which was greater after left-hand squeezing. This observation confirms our previous findings and we have extended them by adding more electrodes to gain further insights into the handgrip exercise as an external brain stimulator. Moreover, we grouped electrodes according to scalp regions to facilitate the visualization of the effects on the frequency spectrum.

We found limited heterogeneity; 48/68 (71%) meta-analyses had nonsignificant heterogeneity, and most (49/68; 72%) were most likely to have zero to small heterogeneity. Power to detect small heterogeneity (as defined by Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003) was low for all projects (mean 43%), but good to excellent for medium and large heterogeneity. Our findings thus show little evidence of widespread heterogeneity in direct replication studies in social and cognitive psychology, suggesting that minor changes in sample population and settings are unlikely to affect research outcomes in these fields of psychology. We also found strong correlations between observed average effect sizes (standardized mean differences and log odds ratios) and heterogeneity in our sample.

Scientific truth, however, is not absolute but relative to time, context, and the method used. Time and context are inextricably intertwined in that time (e.g., Christmas Day vs. New Year's Day) creates different contexts for behaviors and contexts create different experiences of time, rendering psychological phenomena inherently variable. This means that internal and external conditions fluctuate and are different in a replication study vs. the original. Thus, a replication experiment is just another empirical investigation in an ongoing effort to establish scientific truth. Neither the original nor a replication is the final arbiter of whether or not something exists. Discovered patterns need not be permanent laws of human behavior proven by the pinpoint statistical verification through replication. To move forward,phenomenon replicationsare needed to investigate phenomena in different ways, forms, contexts, and times. Such investigations look at phenomena not just in terms the magnitude of their effects but also by their frequency, duration, and intensity in labs and real life. They will also shed light on the extent to which lab manipulations may make many phenomena subjectively conscious events and effects (e.g., causal attributions) when they are nonconsciously experienced in real life, or vice versa.

One such norm is to distort one's own response in a socially desirable direction during interviews. However, findings for such an effect are mixed in the literature. Therefore, a new study on the effect of social desirability bias in human-robot evaluation was conducted, aiming for a conceptual replication of previous findings. In a between-subject laboratory experiment, N=107 participants had to evaluate the robot and the interaction quality after a short conversation in three different groups: In one group, the evaluation was conducted using (1) the same robot of the former interaction, (2) a different robot, (3) a tablet computer. According to the CASA assumption, it was expected, that evaluations on likability and quality of interaction, are higher in the condition with the same robot conducting the evaluation, compared to a different robot or a tablet computer because robots are treated as social actors and hence humans distort ratings in a socially desirable direction. Based on previous findings, we expected robots to evoke higher anthropomorphism and feelings of social presence compared to the tablet computer as potential explanation. However, the data did not support the hypotheses. Low sample size, low statistical power, lack of measurement validation and other problems that could lead to an overestimation of effect sizes-in this study and the literature in general-are discussed in light of the replicability crisis.",,"[Leichtmann, Benedikt; Nitsch, Verena] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Ind Engn & Ergon, Aachen, Germany; [Leichtmann, Benedikt] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Ind Engn & Ergon, Aachen, Germany",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,Robotics,WOS:000566873100001,

Previous attempts at predicting occurrence of sudden gains have yielded equivocal findings. Recently, intraindividual variability in symptoms during treatment was suggested as a trans-therapeutic and trans-diagnostic predictor of sudden gains. The goal of the present study was to examine this predictor in Internet-delivered treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and to examine whether this predictor predicts sudden gains when measured before treatment begins. Method: We examined data from a preregistered randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD (n = 101). We measured variability in symptoms both within-treatment and before treatment (i.e. during waitlist). Results: Intraindividual variability in symptoms significantly predicted sudden gains both when measured before treatment or within-treatment and correctly classified 84% and 83% of individuals to sudden gains versus non-sudden gains status, respectively. Conclusions: Intraindividual variability in symptoms can predict sudden gains in Internet-delivered treatment for SAD, thus supporting its trans-diagnostic and trans-therapeutic nature.

Our research begins with the premise that first proposals can be framed as either an offer of resources (e.g.. I am offering my A for your B) that highlights gains versus a request for resources (e.g., I am requesting your B for my A) that highlights losses to a responder. We propose that this framing would affect the concession aversion of responders and ultimately the negotiated outcomes. We predicted that when a first proposal is framed as an offer, the well-documented anchoring and first-mover advantage effect would emerge because offers do not create high levels of concession aversion. In contrast, because requests highlight what the responder has to give up, we predicted that opening requests would produce concession aversion and eliminate and even reverse the first-mover advantage. Across 5 experiments, the classic first-mover advantage in negotiations was moderated by the framing of proposals because anchor framing affected concession aversion. The studies highlight how motivational forces (i.e., concession aversion) play an important role in producing anchoring effects, which has been predominantly viewed through a purely cognitive lens. Overall, the findings highlight when and how motivational processes play a key role in both judgmental heuristics and mixed-motive decision-making.",,"[Majer, Johann M.; Troetschel, Roman] Leuphana Univ, Social Org & Polit Psychol, Room C1-019, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Galinsky, Adam D.] Columbia Business Sch, Management, New York, NY USA; [Loschelder, David D.] Leuphana Univ, Business & Social Psychol & Expt Methods, Luneburg, Germany; [Majer, Johann M.] Leuphana Univ, Social Org & Polit Psychol, Room C1-019, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Social",WOS:000558638900004,

The current study aimed to replicate and extend the Papa, Lancaster, & Kahler, 2014 study by: (1) assessing common loss responses (prolonged grief, major depression, posttraumatic stress) and role centrality among bereaved, divorced, and unemployed individuals, and (2) exploring posttraumatic growth and stress appraisals among loss groups. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was completed by 372 recently bereaved, divorced, and unemployed individuals. Exploratory factor analysis assessed common loss responses in the bereaved group. In the sample, multiple regressions assessed the relationship between role centrality, stress appraisals, and outcome variables (prolonged grief, posttraumatic growth); correlational analysis assessed the relationship between posttraumatic growth and psychopathology variables; qualitative analysis assessed examples of posttraumatic growth. Results: A subset of each loss group reported prolonged grief and posttraumatic growth. Prolonged grief was a distinct factor from major depression and posttraumatic stress. Role centrality and stress appraisals were significantly associated with outcome variables. There was a weak, positive relationship between posttraumatic growth and psychopathology variables. Limitations: Limitations included convenience sampling and a cross-sectional study design, which precluded assessing responses over time. Strengths included replicating existing literature and incorporating a strength-based measure. Conclusions: Prolonged grief can emerge from death-related loss and role loss. Also, posttraumatic growth can accompany prolonged grief. In clinical practice, loss can be conceptualized broadly beyond bereavement and addressed with the potential for posttraumatic growth.",,"[Klurfeld, Z. B.; Buqo, T.; Sanderson, W.

The problem has been partly attributed to publication bias and unwanted practices such asp-hacking. Low statistical power in individual studies is also understood to be an important factor. In a recent multisite collaborative study, we mapped brain anatomical left-right asymmetries for regional measures of surface area and cortical thickness, in 99 MRI datasets from around the world, for a total of over 17,000 participants. In the present study, we revisited these hemispheric effects from the perspective of reproducibility. Within each dataset, we considered that an effect had been reproduced when it matched the meta-analytic effect from the 98 other datasets, in terms of effect direction and significance threshold. In this sense, the results within each dataset were viewed as coming from separate studies in an ""ideal publishing environment,"" that is, free from selective reporting andphacking. We found an average reproducibility rate of 63.2% (SD= 22.9%, min = 22.2%, max = 97.0%). As expected, reproducibility was higher for larger effects and in larger datasets. Reproducibility was not obviously related to the age of participants, scanner field strength,FreeSurfersoftware version, cortical regional measurement reliability, or regional size.

Crucially, recent findings suggest that this effect can be detected in bilingual infants before their first birthday indicating that it emerges as a result of early bilingual exposure and the experience of negotiating two linguistic systems in infants' environment. However, these conclusions are based on only two research studies from the last decade (Comishen, Bialystok, & Adler, 2019; Kovacs & Mehler, 2009), so to date, there is a lack of evidence regarding their replicability and generalizability. In addition, previous research does not shed light on the precise aspects of bilingual experience and the extent of bilingual exposure underlying the emergence of this early bilingual advantage. The present study addressed these two questions by assessing attentional control abilities in 7-month-old bilingual infants in comparison to same-age monolinguals and in relation to their individual bilingual exposure patterns. Findings did not reveal significant differences between monolingual and bilingual infants in the measure of attentional control and no relation between individual performance and degree of bilingual exposure. Bilinguals showed different patterns of allocating attention to the visual rewards in this task compared to monolinguals. Thus, this study indicates that bilingualism modulates attentional processes early on, possibly as a result of bilinguals' experience of encoding dual-language information from a complex linguistic input, but it does not lead to significant advantages in attentional control in the first year of life.",,"[Kalashnikova, Marina; Pejovic, Jovana; Carreiras, Manuel] BCBL Basque Ctr Cognit Brain & Language, San Sebastian, Spain; [Pejovic, Jovana; Carreiras, Manuel] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, San Sebastian, Spain; [Pejovic, Jovana] Univ Lisbon, Fac Letras, Ctr Linguist, Lab Fonet, Lisbon, Portugal; [Pejovic, Jovana] Univ Lisbon, Fac Letras, Ctr Linguist, Lisbon Baby Lab, Lisbon, Portugal; [Carreiras, Manuel] Ikerbasque Basque Fdn Sci, Bilbao, Spain; [Kalashnikova, Marina] BCBL Basque Ctr Cognit Brain & Language, Mikeletegi Pasealekua 69, Donostia San Sebastian 20009, Gipuzkoa, Spain",,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental; Psychology, Experimental",WOS:000546680500001,

Moreover, failed papers circulate through the literature as quickly as replicating papers. This dynamic weakens the literature, raises research costs, and demonstrates the need for new approaches for estimating a study's replicability. Here, we trained an artificial intelligence model to estimate a paper's replicability using ground truth data on studies that had passed or failed manual replication tests, and then tested the model's generalizability on an extensive set of out-of-sample studies. The model predicts replicability better than the base rate of reviewers and comparably as well as prediction markets, the best present-day method for predicting replicability. In out-of-sample tests on manually replicated papers from diverse disciplines and methods, the model had strong accuracy levels of 0.65 to 0.78.

Kahneman and Tversky's 1979 study tested financial choices under risk, concluding that such judgements deviate significantly from the assumptions of expected utility theory, which had remarkable impacts on science, policy and industry. Though substantial evidence supports prospect theory, many presumed canonical theories have drawn scrutiny for recent replication failures. In response, we directly test the original methods in a multinational study (n = 4,098 participants, 19 countries, 13 languages), adjusting only for current and local currencies while requiring all participants to respond to all items. The results replicated for 94% of items, with some attenuation. Twelve of 13 theoretical contrasts replicated, with 100% replication in some countries. Heterogeneity between countries and intra-individual variation highlight meaningful avenues for future theorizing and applications.

Decades of research have suggested that brain asymmetry may be altered in psychiatric disorders. However, findings have been inconsistent and often based on small sample sizes. There are also open questions surrounding which structures are asymmetrical on average in the healthy population, and how variability in brain asymmetry relates to basic biological variables such as age and sex. Over the last 4 years, the ENIGMA-Laterality Working Group has published six studies of gray matter morphological asymmetry based on total sample sizes from roughly 3,500 to 17,000 individuals, which were between one and two orders of magnitude larger than those published in previous decades. A population-level mapping of average asymmetry was achieved, including an intriguing fronto-occipital gradient of cortical thickness asymmetry in healthy brains. ENIGMA's multi-dataset approach also supported an empirical illustration of reproducibility of hemispheric differences across datasets. Effect sizes were estimated for gray matter asymmetry based on large, international, samples in relation to age, sex, handedness, and brain volume, as well as for three psychiatric disorders: autism spectrum disorder was associated with subtly reduced asymmetry of cortical thickness at regions spread widely over the cortex; pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder was associated with altered subcortical asymmetry; major depressive disorder was not significantly associated with changes of asymmetry. Ongoing studies are examining brain asymmetry in other disorders.

Non-surgical ear molding has emerged as an effective option to treat helical rim deformities and could reduce the need for surgery later in a child's life. Despite this, there has never been a study examining how the general public rates corrections after ear molding. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all consecutive patients with helical rim deformities treated with InfantEar TM Molding System. Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) was used to survey blinded respondents using photographs of patients' ears to determine the degree of normalcy on a scale of 1 (not normal) to 10 (completely normal) before and after molding. Ratings of ears were compared using a pairedttest and percent improvement from baseline. Results: A total of 59 ears met criteria for evaluation by 497 MTurk respondents. Average age of patients at the time of treatment was 34.2 +/- 16.8 days and mean therapy duration was 31.3 +/- 13.1 days. A pairedttest analysis found that MTurk respondents identified significant improvement in 91.5% of ears (n = 54) (P < 0.05). The percent improvement in observed helical rim change was on average 82.7 +/- 61.1%. Conclusion: Ear molding is an effective and safe way to address helical rim deformities early in the neonatal period. The general public is able to recognize ears with rim deformities as abnormal, and appreciate the difference in architecture after molding.

Money priming has also been seen to change behavior in children who have yet develop a complete understanding of its instrumental functions. Since money's association with markets changes people's behavior even in childhood, it is possible that its links and ties to self-esteem are forged at an early stage in life. The studies presented in this article aimed to verify how money priming affects various types of self-evaluations made by children. Two experimental studies were conducted. A total of 83 children aged 8-10 years took part in the first study, while 103 children aged 4-6 years took part in the second study. The results demonstrate that priming with money may change some, but not all, of children's self-evaluations. Subsequent to money priming, children's self-evaluations became more congruent with market mode: under the influence of money priming, children's self-evaluations increased in domains involving perceived competences (associated with feelings of agency), but did not increase in domains related to social relationships.",,"[Trzcinska, Agata] Univ Warsaw, Fac Psychol, Ul Stawki 5-7, PL-00183 Warsaw, Poland; [Trzcinska, Agata] Univ Warsaw, Fac Psychol, Ul Stawki 5-7, PL-00183 Warsaw, Poland",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000528669700001,

With data from four of these projects, we computed probabilistic forecasts of the replication outcomes, which we then evaluated regarding discrimination, calibration and sharpness. A novel model, which can take into account both inflation and heterogeneity of effects, was used and predicted the effect estimate of the replication study with good performance in two of the four data sets. In the other two data sets, predictive performance was still substantially improved compared to the naive model which does not consider inflation and heterogeneity of effects. The results suggest that many of the estimates from the original studies were inflated, possibly caused by publication bias or questionable research practices, and also that some degree of heterogeneity between original and replication effects should be expected. Moreover, the results indicate that the use of statistical significance as the only criterion for replication success may be questionable, since from a predictive viewpoint, non-significant replication results are often compatible with significant results from the original study.

Three studies are reported in which the basic incidental environmental anchoring method of Critcher and Gilovich (2008) is employed to measure consumer price estimations.

The current studies are replications of Wood et al. (2009) study. The aim of Study 1 was to replicate this study by examining the efficacy of a positive affirmation intervention on mood and state self-esteem and to see if trait self-esteem made the intervention more or less efficacious. The aim of Study 2 was to attempt to conceptually replicate and extend the original study by examining the efficacy of positive affirmation and values writing interventions on mood, self-esteem, and goal completion. We also examined whether trait self-esteem and psychological inflexibility moderated the relationship between condition and outcome variables. Design: For Study 1, participants were randomly assigned to either the positive affirmation or no statement condition. Outcome measures were completed immediately following the intervention. For Study 2, participants randomly assigned to the positive affirmations or values writing intervention. Outcome measures were completed immediately following the intervention and at a three-day follow-up. Setting: Participants completed this analogue study in a university setting. Participants: Approximately 225 individuals participated in Study 1 and 237 in Study 2. Main outcome measures: The main outcome measures of Study 1 were state self-esteem and mood measures. The outcome measures for Study 2 were state self-esteem, mood, goal competition, and challenge of self-reported goal. Results: Results from Study 1 revealed a failure to replicate as there were no difference between conditions on all outcome variables and trait-self esteem did not interact with condition to predict any of the outcome variables. Findings from Study 2, again, yielded a failure to replicate, as there were no differences between conditions on mood, state self-esteem, self-reported level of goal challenge, and goal completion.

However, results did not show any meaningful effects for gender, robot appearance or whether one is active or passive in the approach. Most studies lack a theoretical foundation and have methodological weaknesses, including low statistical power or questionable research practices, leading to a high false-positive rate or overestimated effect sizes. Solutions such as pre-registration, higher sample sizes, transparency and a more careful theoretical underpinning based on models of human spacing behavior are discussed.

This crisis has, inter alia, drawn attention to the need for proper control of statistical decision errors in testing psychological hypotheses. However, conventional methods of error probability control often require fairly large samples. Sequential statistical tests provide an attractive alternative: They can be applied repeatedly during the sampling process and terminate whenever there is sufficient evidence in the data for one of the hypotheses of interest. Thus, sequential tests may substantially reduce the required sample size without compromising predefined error probabilities. Herein, we discuss the most efficient sequential design, the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), and show how it is easily implemented for a 2-sample t test using standard statistical software. We demonstrate, by means of simulations, that the SPRT not only reliably controls error probabilities but also typically requires substantially smaller samples than standard t tests and other common sequential designs. Moreover, we investigate the robustness of the SPRT against violations of its assumptions. Finally, we illustrate the sequential t test by applying it to an empirical example and provide recommendations on how psychologists can employ it in their own research to benefit from its desirable properties. Translational Abstract Fostered by a series of unsuccessful attempts to replicate seemingly well-established empirical results, the reproducibility crisis has dominated the public debate in psychological science for several years. Apart from increasing awareness for the consequences of questionable research practices, the crisis has drawn attention to the shortcomings of currently dominating statistical procedures. Critically, conventional methods that allow for control of both Type I and Type II statistical error probabilities-alpha and beta, respectively- often require sample sizes much larger than typically employed. Therefore, we promote an alternative that requires substantially smaller sample sizes on average while still controlling error probabilities: sequential analysis. Unlike conventional tests, sequential tests are designed to be applied repeatedly during the sampling process and terminate as soon as there is sufficient evidence for one of the hypotheses of interest. Herein, we discuss the most efficient sequential design, the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), and show how it is easily implemented for the common t test to compare means of 2 independent groups. We demonstrate by means of simulations that the SPRT reliably controls error probabilities and requires smaller samples than standard t tests or other common sequential designs. Moreover, we investigate the robustness of the SPRT against violations of its assumptions.

Expert procedures, like codes of conduct and court-appointed experts, remain controversial among academics and courts. Much of this discussion, however, has been divorced from the science of the reforms. In this article, the authors draw from emerging work in behavioural ethics and metascience that studies procedures analogous to those that are being used in courts. This work suggests that procedures can be effective, as they have been in science, if directed at key vulnerabilities in the research and reporting process. The authors' analysis of the metascience and behavioural ethics literature also suggests several nuances in how expert evidence procedure ought to be designed and employed. For instance, codes of conduct require specific and direct wording that experts cannot interpret as ethically permissive. Further, drawing on a recent case study, courts have an important role to play in establishing a culture that takes codes as serious ethical responsibilities, and not simply as pro forma requirements.",,"[Chin, Jason M.] Univ Sydney, Sydney Law Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Chin, Jason M.] Inst Globally Distributed Open Res & Educ IGDORE, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [San Roque, Mehera] Univ New South Wales, UNSW Law, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [McFadden, Rory] Univ Queensland, TC Beirne Sch Law, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chin, Jason M.] Univ Sydney, Sydney Law Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Chin, Jason M.] Inst Globally Distributed Open Res & Educ IGDORE, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,Law,WOS:000540180400003,

They show small associations in the r = .10 range between the intensity of SNS use and loneliness, self-esteem, life satisfaction, or self-reported depression, and somewhat stronger links to a thin body ideal and higher social capital. There is no indication for potential devastating effects of social media on school achievement; social media use and school grades are unrelated for adolescents.

We obtain a positive overall effect of intuition on cooperation, though substantially weaker than that reported in prior meta-analyses, and between studies the effect exhibits a high degree of systematic variation.

However, recent meta-analyses conclude that its efficacy is still in question. Recently, an increase in subjects' propensity to mind-wander has been reported as a consequence of anodal stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Axelrod et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 112, 2015). In addition, an independent group found a decrease in mind wandering after cathodal stimulation of the same region. These findings seem to indicate that high-level cognitive processes such as mind wandering can reliably be influenced by non-invasive brain stimulation. However, these previous studies used low sample sizes and are as such subject to concerns regarding the replicability of their findings. In this registered report, we implement a high-powered replication of Axelrod et al. (2015) finding that mind-wandering propensity can be increased by anodal tDCS. We used Bayesian statistics and a preregistered sequential-sampling design resulting in a total sample size of N = 192 participants collected across three different laboratories. Our findings show support against a stimulation effect on self-reported mind-wandering scores. The effect was small, in the opposite direction as predicted and not reliably different from zero. Using a Bayes Factor specifically designed to test for replication success, we found strong evidence against a successful replication of the original study. Finally, even when combining data from both the original and replication studies, we could not find evidence for an effect of anodal stimulation.

Direct empirical evidence for both accounts is scarce, however, and exists mainly for the attribution-of-competence account in a negotiation context. In two experiments, we examined the two competing mechanisms simultaneously (Experiment 1) and contrasted them in a negotiation and in an estimation context (Experiment 2).

However the authors aiming to critically evaluate conducted replications or to conduct a replication study themselves needs to explicitly reflect two crucial issues. The first regards conditions that need to be met in order to consider the second study as a replication of the first. This concerns the definition of replication and broader categorization of replication types from a methodological point of view, reflecting various conceptual and terminological issues. The second regards conditions that need to be met in order to say that the results of the replication study replicated/did not replicate the original study. This involves the way in which the study is statistically analysed with respect to its main goal. Therefore, the aim of the present article is to discuss and to summarize the present state of the literature regarding these two issues and to synthesize it into two functional classifications: A, various types of replications from a methodological point of view; B, various possibilities of data analysis from a statistical point of view.

However, these measures face critical limitations in populations that are inherently difficult to study. Members of difficult-to-study populations (e.g., patients, children, non-human animals) are less accessible to researchers, which typically results in small-sample studies that are infeasible to replicate. Nevertheless, meta-analyses on clinical neuropsychological data suggest that difficult-to-study populations can be studied in a reliable way. These analyses often produce unbiased effect-size estimates despite aggregating across severely underpowered original studies. This finding can be attributed to a neuropsychological research culture involving the non-selective reporting of results from standardized and validated test procedures. Consensus guidelines, test manuals, and psychometric evidence constrain the methodological choices made by neuropsychologists, who regularly report the results from neuropsychological test batteries irrespective of their statistical significance or novelty. Comparable shifts toward more standardization and validation, complete result reports, and between-lab collaborations can allow for a meaningful and reliable study of psychological phenomena in other difficult-to-study populations.",,"[Lange, Florian] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Behav Engn Res Grp, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Lange, Florian] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Behav Engn Res Grp, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000517756900004,

A systematic assessment of the methodological quality of the included studies (k = 41) indicated that most studies suffered from methodological limitations (i.e., poor masking procedures, poor awareness measures, researcher degrees of freedom, and trial-order effects), and that higher quality predicted lower odds of studies concluding in favor of contingency unaware fear conditioning. Furthermore, meta-analytic moderation analyses indicated no evidence for a specific set of conditions under which contingency unaware fear conditioning can be observed.

However, there is a concern that publication bias and selective reporting may lead to biased meta-analytic effect sizes. We compare the results of meta-analyses to large-scale preregistered replications in psychology carried out at multiple laboratories. The multiple-laboratory replications provide precisely estimated effect sizes that do not suffer from publication bias or selective reporting. We searched the literature and identified 15 meta-analyses on the same topics as multiple-laboratory replications. We find that meta-analytic effect sizes are significantly different from replication effect sizes for 12 out of the 15 meta-replication pairs.

Hunger is a fundamental source of motivation and is known to redirect behavior in other domains. The present research aims to test whether hunger influences moral judgments and punishments. Method We first report results from four pilot studies (n = 1354) which, taken together, imply a positive relationship between self-reported hunger and harsher moral judgment. The main preregistered study then examined the effect of experimentally induced hunger on judicial sentencing and moral judgments. Hunger was manipulated by asking 246 undergraduates to not eat for at least four hours before the study. Participants in the Satiated condition received a snack before taking questionnaires, while those in the Hungry condition were given the same snack after responding to the questionnaires. Results Contrary to our pre-registered predictions, participants in the Hungry condition recommended significantly more lenient punishments, while the manipulation had no effect on moral judgment.

However, recent experiments by Sah (2018), have revealed that in certain contexts, advisors give less biased advice with disclosure relative to nondisclosure. To further understand the contradictory findings and increase confidence in the original results, I conducted a direct replication of the main study from Cain et al.

I replicated the original finding that advisors give more biased advice with conflict-of-interest disclosure (vs. without) when giving recommendations on the sale price of houses to advisees who have less information. Like Cain et al., I found little or no support for effects on advisees, such as advisees giving higher estimates, being less accurate, or discounting more, with conflict-of-interest disclosure relative to nondisclosure.

The 1 phenomenon (a cross-over interaction revealing an ease of retrieval effect) that has not been replicated successfully previously in undergraduate samples was also not observed here. However, the observed effect sizes for the replicated phenomena were notably smaller on average than the meta-analytic effect sizes documented by past studies of college students. Furthermore, the phenomena were strongest among participants with the demographic characteristics of the college students who typically provided data for past published studies, even after correcting for publication bias in past studies using a new method, called the behaviorally-informed file-drawer adjustment. The six successful replications suggest that phenomena identified in traditional laboratory research also appear as expected in representative samples but more weakly, so observed effect sizes should be generalized with caution.

In the present research, we administered, in two experiments, the imitation-inhibition task - a robust, unobtrusive, and reliable paradigm that is sensitive to self-other focus on a trial-by-trial basis. A pilot study found an increased focus on the self as compared to others when primed with money. Building on this finding, a preregistered high-powered experiment replicated this effect, suggesting that money primes may indeed increase a focus on the self. An additionally carried out meta-analysis indicates that automatic imitation is modulated by self-other focus and that money primes lead to a smaller focus on the self than conventional methods.

When fields produce noisy measurements, however, the scientific method is not guaranteed to work in fact, noisy measurements are now regarded as a leading cause of the replication crisis in psychology. Scientists should therefore strive to improve the precision of their methods, especially in fields with noisy measurements. Here, we show that automation can reduce measurement error by similar to 60% in one domain of developmental psychology: controlled-rearing studies of newborn chicks. Automated studies produce measurements that are 3-4 times more precise than non-automated studies and produce effect sizes that are 3-4 times larger than non-automated studies. Automation also eliminates experimenter bias and allows replications to be performed quickly and easily. We suggest that automation can be a powerful tool for improving measurement precision, producing high powered experiments, and combating the replication crisis.",,"[Wood, Samantha M.

We replicated the anchoring effect using the sequential anchoring paradigm and showed that, when two anchors of opposite directions are presented, the second seems to influence a subsequent judgment somewhat more. A comparison of a target with another object before the numerical estimate was not sufficient to elicit anchoring, but it might have increased the sequential anchoring effect.

All subjects were tested in a delayed response task using consistent methodology across sites. Individuals could access food rewards by remembering the position of the hidden reward after a 0, 15, or 30-second delay. Overall, individuals performed better with shorter delays, as predicted by previous studies. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a strong phylogenetic signal for short-term memory.

We agree with their premises regarding the limitations of existing analysis methods and regarding the importance of accounting for heterogeneity among the replications. This objective may be interesting in its own right. However, we argue that by focusing only on whether the replication studies have similar effect sizes to one another, these analyses are not particularly appropriate for assessing whether the replications in fact support the scientific effect under investigation or for assessing the power of multisite replication projects.

However, this method lacks safeguards against accuracy overestimation.

To ensure the credibility of gerontology research moving forward, we suggest concrete ways to incorporate open science into gerontology research: for example, by using available preregistration templates adaptable to a variety of study designs typical for aging research (even secondary analyses of existing data).

(2016) reported that in an Austrian sample approximately one in ten respondents incorrectly believed that Austria still practices, or recently practiced, the death penalty, and that there is a positive association between the amount of weekly television viewing and this gross misperception of the Austrian justice system. Methods: An endorsed, prereviewed, preregistered close (N = 597) served to test the veracity of these reported effects. This was coupled with the conceptual extension part, which (a) investigated the potential influence of watching American crime series, (b) accounted for further possible confounds, and (c) tested the generalizability of the effect of television viewing to online streaming. Results: Online survey data (N = 597) replicated the one-in-ten prevalence of incorrect answers with the 5-item death penalty questionnaire used in the original study, but not, when asking directly about Austria's death penalty practices (prevalence: 0.3%). Younger age, but not the amount of television viewing or online streaming, suggestibility, or preferred TV genre consistently predicted incorrect answers in the death penalty questionnaire. Incorrect answers were Mokken-scalable (i.e., formed a common scale, complying with a non-parametric item response model) and were highly consistent. In contrast to the replication study results, a small meta-analysis of all available evidence (three studies, including the present replication) suggested that the aggregate effect of television viewing nominally was significant, albeit small. Conclusion: The replication study yielded mixed results, which indicate the perception of a high prevalence of beliefs that there is capital punishment in a country without death penalty probably is due to a faultily designed questionnaire and thus a research artifact. Also, positive associations of television viewing with such beliefs likely are only small at best.",,"[Boch, Magdalena; Tran, Ulrich S.; Voracek, Martin] Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Dept Basic Psychol Res & Res Methods, Vienna, Austria; [Boch, Magdalena] Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Dept Basic Psychol Res & Res Methods, Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000476764500001,

Study 1 evaluated the persistence of anchoring effects over long durations, and showed that the strength of the effect decayed but did not disappear completely even 8 weeks later. In Study 2, a random anchor significantly influenced WTP after one week, regardless of whether WTP was also elicited immediately following the anchoring procedure, showing that consistency motivations do not account for persistence of anchoring effects. Study 3 showed relatively low anchors resulted in more stable valuations, compared with participants who reported WTP with no anchoring procedure. Together with the pattern of decay over time in Study 1, this suggests that anchoring facilitates the ""imprinting"" of valuation judgments for later retrieval.

Claims about the existence of multiple distinct psychological processes or systems are often based on demonstrations that manipulations such as working memory load, mood or instructions have differential effects on task performance. For example, a manipulation may have a larger effect on performance in one task, and a smaller or no detectable effect in another, as identified by statistical models like analysis of variance. However, inferring distinct underlying processes based on such interaction effects can be misleading. Such an inference depends on the strong - and probably false - assumption that underlying psychological variables map linearly onto the observable dependent variables. Fortunately, state-trace analysis offers an alternative approach to test for multiple underlying variables, avoiding the linearity assumption. We apply state-trace analysis to databases of studies from reasoning and from category learning that have been cited as evidence for qualitatively distinct processes. We show that many of the dissociations thought to reflect the operation of distinct processes disappear against the stricter criteria of state-trace analysis. We argue that it is important for experiments to be designed with state-trace analysis in mind, and highlight the need for the development and more widespread use of similar techniques. This will lead to a more rigorous foundation for theoretical claims about distinct underlying psychological mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

While many studies have been conducted that examine the efficacy of expressive writing across such outcomes, a considerable amount of these studies tend to neglect necessary considerations, such as different levels of symptomatology, power, and meaningfulness of respective effect sizes. Six previous meta-analyses have been conducted that examine expressive writing's effect on psychological outcomes. However, these studies focus on the experimental versus control group effect size. Thus, our meta-analysis sought to examine the efficacy of an expressive writing task on only the experimental conditions in studies measuring posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, and quality of life using random effects models. Results indicated a small overall effect size for posttraumatic stress and negligible to small effect sizes for posttraumatic growth and quality of life.

In preclinical biomedical research, it is common practice to conduct exact replications with the same sample sizes as those used in the initial experiments. Such replication attempts, however, have lower probability of replication than is generally appreciated. Indeed, in the common scenario of an effect just reaching statistical significance, the statistical power of the replication experiment assuming the same effect size is approximately 50%-in essence, a coin toss. Accordingly, we use the provocative analogy of ""replicating"" a neuroprotective drug animal study with a coin flip to highlight the need for larger sample sizes in replication experiments. Additionally, we provide detailed background for the probability of obtaining a significant p value in a replication experiment and discuss the variability of p values as well as pitfalls of simple binary significance testing in both initial preclinical experiments and replication studies with small sample sizes. We conclude that power analysis for determining the sample size for a replication study is obligatory within the currently dominant hypothesis testing framework.

Our study answers the call for a comprehensive meta-analysis examining the available evidence on money priming (Vadillo, Hardwicke, & Shanks, 2016). By conducting a systematic search of published and unpublished literature on money priming, we sought to achieve three key goals. First, we aimed to assess the presence of biases in the available published literature (e.g., publication bias). Second, in the case of such biases, we sought to derive a more accurate estimate of the effect size after correcting for these biases. Third, we aimed to investigate whether design factors such as prime type and study setting moderated the money priming effects. Our overall meta-analysis included 246 suitable experiments and showed a significant overall effect size estimate (Hedges' g = .31, 95% CI [0.26, 0.36]). However, publication bias and related biases are likely given the asymmetric funnel plots, Egger's test and two other tests for publication bias. Moderator analyses offered insight into the variation of the money priming effect, suggesting for various types of study designs whether the effect was present, absent, or biased. We found the largest money priming effect in lab studies investigating a behavioral dependent measure using a priming technique in which participants actively handled money.

In this reply, we comment on several contradictions in Sundie et al.'s article. First, they suggest that Shanks et al.'s replication experiments yielded different results from the original studies because we failed to appreciate the contextual sensitivity of romantic priming effects, but this argument rests largely on evidence from the very studies we were unable to replicate, and a wealth of other evidence suggests that social priming effects are largely invariant across samples and settings. Second, Sundie et al. criticize the selection rule by which Shanks et al. identified relevant priming studies, but then go on to include exactly the same set of studies in their p-curve analysis. Third, they criticize Shanks et al.'s selection of statistical results from these studies and propose a much wider selection, but then acknowledge that their selection process is poorly suited to assessing publication bias and p-hacking. Fourth, we show that their p-curve analysis, far from demonstrating that this literature is unaffected by p-hacking, in fact shows the exact opposite. Sundie et al. claim that Shanks et al.'s priming manipulation was demonstrably weak, but their argument is based on a confusion between different dependent measures.

In three experiments, we found that exposure to American, Australian, and British flags reduced Americans', Australians', and Britons' tax evasion in financially incentivized tasks (Experiments 1, 3) and increased tax-paying attitudes (Experiment 2).

Study results suggest that religiosity has a positive effect on attitudes toward charitable organizations, AHO, and donating to charity.

The method built on an existing counter-stereotype training procedure, using targeted memory reactivation to strengthen counter-stereotype memory by playing cues associated with the training during a 90min nap. If effective, this procedure would have potential real-world usefulness in reducing implicit biases and their myriad effects. We replicated this procedure on a sample of n = 31 college students. Contrary to the results reported by Hu et al., we found no effect of cueing on implicit bias, either immediately following the nap or one week later. In fact, bias was non-significantly greater for cued than for uncued stimuli. Our failure to detect an effect of cueing on implicit bias could indicate either that the original report was a false positive, or that the current study is a false negative. However, several factors argue against Type II error in the current study. Critically, this replication was powered at 0.9 for detecting the originally reported cueing effect. Additionally, the 95% confidence interval for the cueing effect in the present study did not overlap with that of the originally reported effect; therefore, our observations are not easily explained as a noisy estimate of the same underlying effect. Ultimately, the outcome of this replication study reduces our confidence that cueing during sleep can reduce implicit bias.",,"[Wamsley, Erin J.] Furman Univ, Dept Psychol, Greenville, SC 29613 USA; Furman Univ, Program Neurosci, Greenville, SC 29613 USA; [Wamsley, Erin J.] Furman Univ, Dept Psychol, Greenville, SC 29613 USA",,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,WOS:000457037500167,

Replicability was also mixed: although in every instance we confirmed above-chance statistical word segmentation, many theoretically important moderations of that learning failed to replicate.

A nonreplication could indicate that a previous finding might have been a false positive statistical result and the effect does not exist. However, it could also mean that a specific detail of the experimental procedure is essential for the effect to emerge, which might not have been included in the replication attempt. Therefore any replication attempt that does not replicate the original effect is most informative when the original procedure is closely adhered to. One proposed solution to facilitate the empirical reproducibility of the experimental procedures in psychology is to upload the experimental script and materials to a public repository. However, we believe that merely providing the materials of an experimental procedure is not sufficient, as many software solutions are not freely available, software solutions might change, and it is time consuming to set up the procedure. We argue that there is a simple solution to these problems when an experiment is conducted using computers: recording an example procedure with a screen capture software and providing the video in an online repository. We therefore provide a brief tutorial on screen recordings using an open source screen recording software. With this information, individual researchers should be able to record their experimental procedures and we hope to facilitate the use of screen recordings in computer assisted data collection procedures.",,"[Heycke, Tobias] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Mannheim, Germany; [Spitzer, Lisa] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Heycke, Tobias] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Mannheim, Germany",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000500711000012,

Through two pre-registered studies (N = 193, collected on campus and N = 543, online participation), we investigate whether disclosing that anonymized data will be publicly shared vs. not shared influences a potential participants' intention to take part in the study. Using both frequentist and Bayesian analysis, we conclude towards an absence of effect of a difference in data sharing policy on scores in the Big Five questionnaire and social desirability, careless response behavior, and results in the anchoring paradigm. In the second study, a lexicometric analysis of participants' reactions to openly sharing data reveals a readiness to share data and support transparency under the condition of preserved anonymity.

Current large-scale replication projects represent an important step forward for assessing replicability, but provide only limited information because they have thus far been designed in a manner such that heterogeneity either cannot be assessed or is intended to be eliminated. Consequently, the nontrivial degree of heterogeneity found in these projects represents a lower bound on the true degree of heterogeneity. We recommend enriching large-scale replication projects going forward by embracing heterogeneity. We argue this is the key for assessing replicability: if effect sizes are sufficiently heterogeneous-even if the sign of the effect is consistent-the phenomenon in question does not seem particularly replicable and the theory underlying it seems poorly constructed and in need of enrichment. Uncovering why and revising theory in light of it will lead to improved theory that explains heterogeneity and increases replicability.

However, previous attempts at predicting sudden gains have yielded inconclusive findings. The aim of the present study was to examine a novel, transdiagnostic, transtherapeutic predictor of sudden gains that would replicate in different settings and populations. Specifically, we examined intraindividual variability in symptoms. Method: We examined data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of prolonged exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents (n = 63), an RCT of cognitive and behavioral therapies for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in adults (n = 91), and psychodynamic therapy delivered under routine clinical conditions in a naturalistic setting for diverse disorders (n = 106). In all 3 data sets, we examined whether a measure of variability in symptoms occurring during the first sessions could predict sudden gains. Results: Variability in symptoms was found to be independent of total change during treatment. Variability in symptoms significantly predicted sudden gains in all 3 data sets and correctly classified 81.0%, 69.2%, and 76.9% of individuals to sudden gain or nonsudden gain status, respectively. Conclusions: The present study represents the first examination of variability in symptoms as a predictor of sudden gains.

Drawing from research on interpersonal perceptions, we test competing hypotheses indicating that phantom anchors might elicit perceptions of manipulativeness or benevolence, with economic implications. Finally, we explore situational conditions that could moderate these perceptions. Five studies show that negotiators using offers with (versus without) phantom anchors receive less aggressive counteroffers and more beneficial agreements in both distributive and integrative negotiations, but also seem more manipulative. Situations portraying the phantom anchor-actual offer combination as a true concession, however, dampen manipulativeness perceptions.

This manuscript reports direct replications of three key experiments reported by Ottati et al. 2015 in this journal in support of the Earned Dogmatism Hypothesis. Consistent with the original findings, it was found that dogmatic behavior is considered substantially more appropriate for experts relative to novices (d = 0.45 [0.35, 0.55] over all replications and original study). In addition, it was confirmed that when participants envision themselves as experts they predict they will be more close-minded (d = -0.54 [-0.64, -0.44]). Unfortunately, replications involving manipulation of expertise through task difficulty showed little to no effect on open-minded cognition (d = 0.00 [-0.21, 0.21] for easy/difficult recall task; d = -0.02 [-0.21, -0.17] for easy/difficult trivia task).

Therefore, they should not be learning to use and accept QRPs, which would reduce their ability to produce and evaluate meaningful research. 207 psychology students and fresh graduates provided self-report data on the prevalence and predictors of QRPs. Attitudes towards QRPs, belief that significant results constitute better science or lead to better grades, motivation, and stress levels were predictors. Furthermore, we assessed perceived supervisor attitudes towards QRPs as an important predictive factor. The results were in line with estimates of QRP prevalence from academia. The best predictor of QRP use was students' QRP attitudes. Perceived supervisor attitudes exerted both a direct and indirect effect via student attitudes. Motivation to write a good thesis was a protective factor, whereas stress had no effect. Students in this sample did not subscribe to beliefs that significant results were better for science or their grades. Such beliefs further did not impact QRP attitudes or use in this sample. Finally, students engaged in more QRPs pertaining to reporting and analysis than those pertaining to study design. We conclude that supervisors have an important function in shaping students' attitudes towards QRPs and can improve their research practices by motivating them well.

In recent years, animal welfare scientists have embraced cognitive sciences to rise to the challenge of determining an animal's internal state in order to better understand its welfare needs and by extension, the needs of larger groups of animals. A wide range of cognitive tests have been developed that can be applied in farmed species to assess a range of cognitive traits. However, this has also presented challenges. Whilst it may be expected to see cognitive variation at the species level, differences in cognitive ability between and within individuals of the same species have frequently been noted but left largely unexplained. Not accounting for individual variation may result in misleading conclusions when the results are applied both at an individual level and at higher levels of scale. This has implications both for our fundamental understanding of an individual's welfare needs, but also more broadly for experimental design and the justification for sample sizes in studies using animals. We urgently need to address this issue. In this review, we will consider the latest developments on the causes of individual variation in cognitive outcomes, such as the choice of cognitive test, sex, breed, age, early life environment, rearing conditions, personality, diet, and the animal's microbiome.

To address this gap, we conducted experimental investigations of reactions to identical, highly qualified men or women job applicants described as either transgender or cisgender (Experiments 1a, 1b), and tested the efficacy of an imagined intergroup contact (IIC) intervention (relative to a control condition) in ameliorating GIB against transgender women (Experiment 2). As expected, all applicants were perceived as equally highly competent, adding to the literature suggesting that clearly demonstrating excellent qualifications can prevent biased judgments of candidate competence. However, revealing GIB, transgender men and women were rated as less likeable and hirable than the identical cisgender applicants, despite the fact that they were viewed as equally competent (Experiments 1a, 1b). Providing additional evidence of GIB, in the absence of IIC, participants rated a transgender female applicant as less likeable and hirable than the identical cisgender applicant, and also reported less self-other overlap and perspective taking for the transgender applicant (Experiment 2). However, these target gender identity differences were reduced (for likeability) or fully eliminated (for the remaining outcomes) in the IIC condition.

We have developed a hybrid method that does take the statistical significance of an original study into account and enables (a) accurate effect size estimation, (b) estimation of a confidence interval, and (c) testing of the null hypothesis of no effect. We analytically approximate the performance of the hybrid method and describe its statistical properties. By applying the hybrid method to data from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (Open Science Collaboration, 2015), we demonstrate that the conclusions based on the hybrid method are often in line with those of the replication, suggesting that many published psychological studies have smaller effect sizes than those reported in the original study, and that some effects may even be absent.

Specifically, we hypothesized that due to their decline, automatic motivational processes are less likely to be spontaneously activated in old age; thus, implicit external activation of them should have stronger effects on older (vs. younger) adults. In two experiments we used different methods of implicitly activating motivation, and measured executive functions of younger and older adults using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. In both experiments, implicit modulation of motivation resulted in improved executive functioning for older adults.

We attempted to replicate these coldness findings for price anchors in a distributive negotiations scenario and to illuminate the potential interplay of coldness priming with a price versus bartering manipulation. Participants (N = 219) were recruited for a 2 x 2 between-subjects negotiation experiment manipulating (1) monetary focus and (2) temperature priming. Our data show a higher anchoring susceptibility in price negotiations than in bartering transactions. Despite a successful priming manipulation check, coldness priming did not affect participants' anchoring susceptibility (nor interact with the price/ bartering manipulation).

Following a discussion of a published large-scale replication study and a review of the meta-analysis literature, we come to the conclusion that many effects are small and that on average the variance of the effects is roughly 10% to 25% of the population variance, most likely because of context dependencies. The proposed explanations such as questionable and suboptimal research practices (low power, poor measurement quality, and the use of NHST) are discussed, as well as more distal explanatory factors such as journals, funding agencies, and institutions. Special attention is given to a third kind of explanatory factor that is situated in a psychological reality that comprises small and varying effect sizes. These factors may cause problems even in the absence of researcher-controlled factors. The proposed remedies for proximal problems insist on more power, more replications, more meta-analysis, higher reliability coefficients, and alternatives for NHST. Based on a discussion we formulate critical and less critical remarks regarding these recommendations. We believe there should be room for a diversity of perspectives and approaches. Small and varying effects attributable to complexity and context dependency of human behavior are considered to be great challenges and may lead to an adjustment of research and analysis methods.

Until highly automated cars are available, knowledge on this topic has to be obtained via simulators and self-report questionnaires. Using crowdsourcing, we surveyed 1692 people on auditory, visual, and vibrotactile take-over requests (TORs) in highly automated driving. The survey presented recordings of auditory messages and illustrations of visual and vibrational messages in traffic scenarios of various urgency levels. Multimodal TORs were the most preferred option in high-urgency scenarios. Auditory TORs were the most preferred option in low urgency scenarios and as a confirmation message that the system is ready to switch from manual to automated mode. For low-urgency scenarios, visual-only TORs were more preferred than vibration-only TORs. Beeps with shorter interpulse intervals were perceived as more urgent, with Stevens' power law yielding an accurate fit to the data. Spoken messages were more accepted than abstract sounds, and the female voice was more preferred than the male voice. Preferences and perceived urgency ratings were similar in middle- and high-income countries. In summary, this international survey showed that people's preferences for TOR types in highly automated driving depend on the urgency of the situation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These questions can and should be studied empirically, and I present my predictions here. The productivity of individual researchers is likely to decline, although some changes (e.g., greater collaboration, data sharing) may mitigate this effect. The effects of these changes on creativity are likely to be mixed: Researchers will be less likely to pursue risky questions; more likely to use a broad range of methods, designs, and populations; and less free to define their own best practices and standards of evidence.

I demonstrate this by reporting a recent experiment carried out within a cognitive linguistic framework on the effects of regular transactive versus reciprocal verbs in news reports of political protests. Results of the experiment show that in the context of media discourse on political protests, the presentation of these alternative constructions, as well as differences in information sequence, affect how people apportion blame and the level of aggression they perceive in social actors.

That movement has accelerated in the last decade, facilitated in large part by cheap and convenient Internet participant recruiting platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk. The widespread use of online subjects, a practice that dramatically lowers the barriers to entry for experimental research, has been controversial. At the same time, the field of experimental psychology is experiencing a public crisis of confidence widely discussed in terms of the replication crisis. At present, law and psychology research is arguably in a new era, in which it is both an accepted feature of the legal landscape and also a target of fresh skepticism. The moment is ripe for taking stock. In this article, we bring an empirical approach to these problems. Using three canonical law and psychology findings, we document the challenges and the feasibility of reproducing results across platforms. We evaluate the extent to which we are able to reproduce the original findings with contemporary subject pools (Amazon Mechanical Turk, other national online platforms, and in-person labs). We partially replicate all three results, and show marked similarities in subject responses across platforms. In the context of the experiments here, we conclude that meaningful replication requires active intervention in order to keep the materials relevant and sensible. The second aim is to compare Amazon Mechanical Turk subjects to the original samples and to the replication samples. We find, consistent with the weight of recent evidence, that the Amazon Mechanical Turk samples are reasonably appropriate for these kinds of scenario studies. Subjects are highly similar to subjects on other online platforms and in-person samples, though they differ in their high level of attentiveness.

The Cardiovascular (CV) Toolkit project entails implementation of a toolkit designed to reduce CV risk by increasing women's engagement in appropriate services. The CV Toolkit project follows an enhanced version of Replicating Effective Programs (REP), an evidence-based implementation strategy, to implement the CV Toolkit across four phases: pre-conditions, pre-implementation, implementation, and maintenance and evolution. Our current objective is to describe a method for mapping implementation strategies used in real time as part of the CV Toolkit project. This method supports description of the timing and content of bundled strategies and provides a structured process for developing a plan for implementation evaluation. Methods: We conducted a process of strategy mapping to apply Proctor and colleagues' rubric for specification of implementation strategies, constructing a matrix in which we identified each implementation strategy, its conceptual group, and the corresponding REP phase(s) in which it occurs. For each strategy, we also specified the actors involved, actions undertaken, action targets, dose of the implementation strategy, and anticipated outcome addressed. We iteratively refined the matrix with the implementation team, including use of simulation to provide initial validation. Results: Mapping revealed patterns in the timing of implementation strategies within REP phases. Most implementation strategies involving the development of stakeholder interrelationships and training and educating stakeholders were introduced during the pre-conditions or pre-implementation phases. Strategies introduced in the maintenance and evolution phase emphasized communication, re-examination, and audit and feedback. In addition to its value for producing valid and reliable process evaluation data, mapping implementation strategies has informed development of a pragmatic blueprint for implementation and longitudinal analyses and evaluation activities. Discussion: We update recent recommendations on specification of implementation strategies by considering the implications for multi-strategy frameworks and propose an approach for mapping the use of implementation strategies within complex, multi-level interventions, in support of rigorous evaluation.

(2) The belief that one can control her/ his weight (attribution theory). And (3) the beliefs that most people prefer thin people and that weight is important (socio-cultural theory). Methods: Participants were 66,799 volunteers (47,265 women, mean age of 27.88 +/- 11.9 years) who completed the Thin-Fat Implicit Association Test on the Project Implicit website (https://implicit.harvard.edu/) during 2016. Explicit anti-fat bias and weight-related attitudes and beliefs were assessed by self-report. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to examine links between weight-related attitudes and beliefs and anti-fat bias. Results: All tested weight-related attitudes and beliefs were significantly (p < .001) correlated with explicit and implicit anti-fat bias, but some of the correlations were very weak. An examination of the relative contribution of the tested weight-related attitudes and beliefs to a model explaining anti-fat bias suggested that the strongest correlates of explicit anti-fat bias were the beliefs that weight was important (beta = 0.194, p < .001), that most people prefer thin people (beta = 0.177, p < .001), and that the respondent was like people who are fat (beta= - 0.180, p < .001). Discussion: The social-identity and socio-cultural theories may provide a stronger explanation for anti-fat bias relative to attribution theory. Future research could use longitudinal designs with more reliable measures in order to verify these cross-sectional findings.",,"[Elran-Barak, Roni] Univ Haifa, Fac Social Welf & Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Haifa, Israel; [Bar-Anan, Yoav] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Psychol, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Elran-Barak, Roni] Univ Haifa, Sch Publ Hlth, 199 Aba Khoushy Ave, Haifa, Israel",,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Social Sciences, Biomedical",WOS:000441482800014,

Using the characteristics that were rated in Experiment 1, we then constructed vignettes that were either 'masculine' or 'feminine', and manipulated whether the vignettes were said to describe a boy or a girl.

We build on this work by investigating the role played by three measurement types: ratings, proportions and unbounded (measures without conceptual upper limits, e.g. time). Both replicability and effect sizes are dependent on the amount of variability due to extraneous factors. We predicted that the role of such extraneous factors might depend on measurement type, and would be greatest for ratings, intermediate for proportions and least for unbounded. Our results support this conjecture. OSC replication rates for unbounded, 43% and proportion 40% combined are reliably higher than those for ratings at 20% (effect size, w = .20).

In the original study, participants either circled first-person plural (interdependent condition) or singular pronouns (independent condition) when reading a passage and subsequently memorized and recalled a set of objects presented on a visual-spatial grid. When employing a digital version of the original procedure, we were able to replicate the original findings, with better recall of objects in their original location in the interdependent (vs. independent) condition. Notably, the effect of self-construal priming on spatial memory was strongest when screening out participants who did not comply with instructions on the pronoun task and absent when including non-compliant participants. Moreover, in contrast to the original study, effects of priming were not specific to object- &-location operationalization of spatial memory recall, and also present for location-independent object recall and object-independent spatial placement recall. Additionally, condition effects were robust across observed cultural differences: Though white participants performing less successfully compared to non-white participants, both groups were comparably susceptible to priming effects.

We found a corrected overall effect size of d = 0.52, which is considerably higher than the effect reported by Kuhberger (d = 0.31). Similarly to the original analysis, most moderators proved to be effective, indicating that there is not the risky-choice framing effect. Rather, the effect size varies with different manipulations of the framing task. Taken together, the p-curve analysis shows that there are reliable risky-choice framing effects, and that there is no evidence of intense p-hacking. Comparing the corrected estimate to the effect size reported in the Many Labs Replication Project (MLRP) on gain-loss framing (d = 0.60) shows that the two estimates are surprisingly similar in size. Finally, we conducted a new meta-analysis of risk framing experiments published in 2016 and again found a similar effect size (d = 0.56).

We review recent research showing anti-immigrant attitudes among the youth across the globe, and how these attitudes are related to parental and peer relationships. Research indicates that a color-blind approach to prejudice reduction among youth is not helpful and, in contrast, it suggests a more effective approach could be a multicultural approach to diversity, which celebrates both group differences and similarities while promoting social integration through quality contact between different social groups. Recent psychological research shows that this contact can take many forms, ranging from direct contact (i.e., cross-ethnic friendships), to extended contact (i.e., reading a book in which someone from your group has a positive interaction with someone from another group) and even imagined contact (i.e., engaging in imagined play involving characters from different groups having positive relations).

The current paper uses video game violence research as an example of how such issues may develop in a field. Despite decades of research, evidence on whether violent video games (WGs) contribute to aggression in players has remained mixed. Concerns have been raised in recent years that experiments regarding VVGs may suffer from both ""false positives"" and ""false negatives."" The current paper examines this issue in three sets of video game experiments, two sets of video game experiments on aggression and prosocial behaviors identified in meta-analysis, and a third group of recent null studies. Results indicated that studies of VVGs and aggression appear to be particularly prone to false positive results. Studies of VVGs and prosocial behavior, by contrast are heterogeneous and did not demonstrate any indication of false positive results. However, their heterogeneous nature made it difficult to base solid conclusions on them. By contrast, evidence for false negatives in null studies was limited, and little evidence emerged that null studies lacked power in comparison those highlighted in past meta -analyses as evidence for effects. These results are considered in light of issues related to false positives and negatives in behavioral science more broadly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It is generally accepted that exposure to an environmental cue can shift attitudes and behaviours, at least partly or temporarily, in a manner that is consistent with that cue. Yet, the same cue can mean different things to different people. In the same vein, given how national identity and political ideology are intertwined in the United States, we hypothesize that the American flag should heighten different political beliefs depending on individuals' political ideology. To Democrats, being American is to support Democratic values, but to Republicans, being American is to support Republican values. The American flag thus should heighten Democrats of their Democratic identity, and it should heighten Republicans of their Republican one.

Yet, the physical isolation of MTurk participants, and perceived lack of experimental control have led to persistent concerns about the quality of the data that can be obtained from MTurk samples. In this paper we focus on two of the most salient concerns that MTurk participants may not buy into interactive experiments and that they may produce unreliable or invalid data. We review existing research on these topics and present new data to address these concerns. We find that insufficient attention is no more a problem among MTurk samples than among other commonly used convenience or high-quality commercial samples, and that MTurk participants buy into interactive experiments and trust researchers as much as participants in laboratory studies. Furthermore, we find that employing rigorous exclusion methods consistently boosts statistical power without introducing problematic side effects (e.g., substantially biasing the post-exclusion sample), and can thus provide a general solution for dealing with problematic respondents across samples.

Family dogs have become a favoured species in comparative cognition research, but they may be subject to cognitive differences arising from genetic (breeding lines) or cultural differences (e.g. preferred training methods). Such variation is of concern as it affects the validity and generalisability of experimental results. Despite its importance, this problem has not been specifically addressed to date. Therefore, we aimed to test the influence of three factors on reproducibility: testing site (proximal environment), breed and sex (phenotype). The same experimenter tested cognitive performance by more than 200 dogs in four experiments. Additionally, dogs' performance was tested in an obedience task administered by the owner. Breed of dog and testing site were found to influence the level of performance only mildly, and only in a means-end experiment and the obedience task.

Together with stability, these make up a collection of virtues that we think is helpful in discussions of statistical foundations and practice. The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other and that they give more specific guidance about what statistical science strives to achieve. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjective or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledgement of multiple perspectives as complementary goals.

The robustness of various published research findings on the valuations of speech-based warning messages is unclear. This research aimed to establish how people value speech-based take-over requests as a function of speech rate, background noise, spoken phrase, and speaker's gender and emotional tone. By means of crowd sourcing, 2669 participants from 95 countries listened to a random 10 out of 140 take-over requests, and rated each take-over request on urgency, commandingness, pleasantness, and ease of understanding. Our results replicate several published findings, in particular that an increase in speech rate results in a monotonic increase of perceived urgency. The female voice was easier to understand than a male voice when there was a high level of background noise, a finding that contradicts the literature. Moreover, a take-over request spoken with Indian accent was found to be easier to understand by participants from India than by participants from other countries. Our results replicate effects in the literature regarding speech-based warnings, and shed new light on effects of background noise, gender, and nationality. The results may have implications for the selection of appropriate take-over requests in automated driving.

When an evidence-based intervention (EBI) is implemented with fidelity in a setting that is very similar to the setting wherein it was previously found to be effective, it is reasonable to anticipate similar benefits of that EBI. However, one goal of implementation science is to expand the use of EBIs as broadly as is feasible and appropriate in order to foster the greatest public health impact. When implementing an EBI in a novel setting, or targeting novel populations, one must consider whether there is sufficient justification that the EBI would have similar benefits to those found in earlier trials. Discussion: In this paper, we introduce a new concept for implementation called ""scaling-out"" when EBIs are adapted either to new populations or new delivery systems, or both. Using existing external validity theories and multilevel mediation modeling, we provide a logical framework for determining what new empirical evidence is required for an intervention to retain its evidence-based standard in this new context. The motivating questions are whether scale-out can reasonably be expected to produce population-level effectiveness as found in previous studies, and what additional empirical evaluations would be necessary to test for this short of an entirely new effectiveness trial. We present evaluation options for assessing whether scaling-out results in the ultimate health outcome of interest. Conclusion: In scaling to health or service delivery systems or population/community contexts that are different from the setting where the EBI was originally tested, there are situations where a shorter timeframe of translation is possible. We argue that implementation of an EBI in a moderately different setting or with a different population can sometimes ""borrow strength"" from evidence of impact in a prior effectiveness trial. The collection of additional empirical data is deemed necessary by the nature and degree of adaptations to the EBI and the context. Our argument in this paper is conceptual, and we propose formal empirical tests of mediational equivalence in a follow-up paper.",,"[Aarons, Gregory A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Aarons, Gregory A.] Child & Adolescent Serv Res Ctr, San Diego, CA 92123 USA; [Sklar, Marisa] Brown Univ, Dept Psychiat & Human Behav, Box G-A1, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Mustanski, Brian; Benbow, Nanette; Brown, C.

Here, we extend FER2015's analysis to suggest that much of the discussion of best research practices since 2011 has focused on a single feature of high-quality science-replicability-with insufficient sensitivity to the implications of recommended practices for other features, like discovery, internal validity, external validity, construct validity, consequentiality, and cumulativeness. Thus, although recommendations for bolstering replicability have been innovative, compelling, and abundant, it is difficult to evaluate their impact on our science as a whole, especially because many research practices that are beneficial for some features of scientific quality are harmful for others. For example, FER2015 argued that bigger samples are generally better, but also noted that very large samples (""those larger than required for effect sizes to stabilize""; p. 291) could have the downside of commandeering resources that would have been better invested in other studies. In their critique of FER2015, LeBel, Campbell, and Loving (2016) concluded, based on simulated data, that ever-larger samples are better for the efficiency of scientific discovery (i.e., that there are no tradeoffs). As demonstrated here, however, this conclusion holds only when the replicator's resources are considered in isolation. If we widen the assumptions to include the original researcher's resources as well, which is necessary if the goal is to consider resource investment for the field as a whole, the conclusion changes radically-and strongly supports a tradeoff-based analysis.

An examination of the state of the current literature suggests that most published looking-time studies have low power, which leads in the long run to an increase in both false positive and false negative results. Three data sets with relatively large samples (>30 infants) were used to simulate experiments with smaller sample sizes; 1,000 random subsamples of 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 infants from the overall samples were selected, making it possible to examine the systematic effect of sample size on the results. This approach revealed that despite clear results with the original large samples, the results with smaller subsamples were highly variable, yielding both false positive and false negative outcomes. Finally, a number of emerging possible solutions are discussed.",,"[Oakes, Lisa M.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA USA; [Oakes, Lisa M.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Mind & Brain, Davis, CA 95618 USA",,,,ICIS Meeting on Best Practices in Infancy Research,2016,,"New Orleans, LA",39,,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental",WOS:000403931500003,

Despite these criticisms, this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it appeals to researcher's intuition to collect more data to push an indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution, we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure, which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached. This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF design typically needs 50% to 70% smaller samples to reach a conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same or lower long-term rate of wrong inference.",,"[Schoenbrodt, Felix D.; Zehetleitner, Michael] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Psychol, Munich, Germany; [Wagenmakers, Eric-Jan] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Perugini, Marco] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy; [Zehetleitner, Michael] Catholic Univ Eichstatt Ingolstadt, Eichstatt, Germany; [Schoenbrodt, Felix D.] Leopoldstr 13, D-80802 Munich, Germany",,,,,,,,124,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000403498200007,

The Reproducibility Project: Psychology sought to replicate the effects of 100 psychology studies. Though 97% of the original studies produced statistically significant results, only 36% of the replication studies did so (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This inability to replicate previously published results, however, is not limited to psychology (Ioannidis, 2005). Replication projects in medicine (Prinz et al., 2011) and behavioral economics (Camerer et al., 2016) resulted in replication rates of 25 and 61%, respectively, and analyses in genetics (Munafo, 2009) and neuroscience (Button et al., 2013) question the validity of studies in those fields. Science, in general, is reckoning with challenges in one of its basic tenets: replication. Comparative psychology also faces the grand challenge of producing replicable research. Though social psychology has born the brunt of most of the critique regarding failed replications, comparative psychology suffers from some of the same problems faced by social psychology (e.g., small sample sizes). Yet, comparative psychology follows the methods of cognitive psychology by often using within-subjects designs, which may buffer it from replicability problems (Open Science Collaboration, 2015).

Inaddition, not enough attention was paid to the strategies used by participants, and there was alack of theories implemented as computer models offering sufficient precision for being tested rigorously. He proposed a three-headed research program: to develop computational models ableto carry out the task they aimed to explain; to study one complex task in detail, such as chess; and to build computational models that can account for multiple tasks. This article assesses the extent to which the papers in this issue advance Newell's program. While half of the papers devote much attention to strategies, several papers still average across them, a capital sin according to Newell. The three courses of action he proposed were not popular in these papers: Only two papers used computational models, with no model being both able to carry out the task and to account for human data; there was no systematic analysis of a specific video game; and no paper proposed a computational model accounting for human data in several tasks. It is concluded that, while they use sophisticated methods of analysis and discuss interesting results, overall these papers contribute only little to Newell's program of research. In this respect, they reflect the current state of psychology and cognitive science.

We report three experiments that examined this idea in the context of risky choice. Experiment 1 (N = 100) appeared to find evidence for an interaction whereby participants primed but not reminded of the prime showed an assimilation effect (e.g. participants primed to be risk seeking became more risk seeking) whereas those who were primed and reminded showed a contrast effect (e.g. became less risk seeking). However, two further experiments (N= 180, N = 128) failed to find any evidence for this interaction, and none of the experiments found evidence for the asymmetry in awareness predicted by an 'unconscious' assimilation but 'conscious' contrast account. The data were analysed using both Null Hypothesis Significance Testing and Bayesian methods, and the implications of the conclusions arising from each are discussed.

Many have responded by pointing out conceptual or methodological discrepancies between the original and replication studies as potential explanations for divergent results as well as emphasizing the importance of contextual moderators. To illustrate the importance of accounting for discrepancies between original and replication studies as well as moderators, we turn to a recent example of a failed replication effort. Previous research has shown that individual differences in need for cognition interact with a message's argument quality to affect evaluation (Cacioppo, Petty, & Morris, 1983). However, a recent attempt failed to replicate this outcome (Ebersole et al., 2016). We propose that the latter study's null result was due to conducting a non-optimal replication attempt. We thus conducted a new study that manipulated the key features that we propose created non-optimal conditions in the replication effort. The current results replicated the original need for cognition x argument quality interaction but only under the ""optimal"" conditions (closer to the original study's method and accounting for subsequently identified moderators). Under the non-optimal conditions, mirroring those used by Ebersole et al., results replicated the failure to replicate the target interaction. These findings emphasize the importance of informed replication, an approach to replication that pays close attention to ongoing developments identified in an effect's broader literature.

This moderation is demonstrated across three effects associated with power: confidence, disobedience, and unethical behavior. This moderation occurs regardless of whether ease of retrieval was measured or manipulated.

This converged naming pattern differs from the monolingual naming patterns of both a bilinguals languages. We conducted a pre-registered replication study of experiments addressing the question whether there is a convergence between a bilinguals both lexicons. The replication used an enlarged set of stimuli of common household containers, providing generalizability, and more reliable representations of the semantic domain. Both an analysis at the group-level and at the individual level of the correlations between naming patterns reject the two-pattern hypothesis that poses that bilinguals use two monolingual-like naming patterns, one for each of their two languages.

Since this convergence is only partial the naming pattern in bilinguals corresponds to a moderate version of the one-pattern hypothesis.

The concern for false positives has overshadowed the concern for false negatives in the recent debates in psychology. This might be unwarranted, since reported statistically nonsignificant findings may just be 'too good to be false'. We examined evidence for false negatives in nonsignificant results in three different ways. We adapted the Fisher test to detect the presence of at least one false negative in a set of statistically nonsignificant results. Simulations show that the adapted Fisher method generally is a powerful method to detect false negatives. We examined evidence for false negatives in the psychology literature in three applications of the adapted Fisher method. These applications indicate that (i) the observed effect size distribution of nonsignificant effects exceeds the expected distribution assuming a null-effect, and approximately two out of three (66.7%) psychology articles reporting nonsignificant results contain evidence for at least one false negative, (ii) nonsignificant results on gender effects contain evidence of true nonzero effects, and (iii) the statistically nonsignificant replications from the Reproducibility Project Psychology (RPP) do not warrant strong conclusions about the absence or presence of true zero effects underlying these nonsignificant results. We conclude that false negatives deserve more attention in the current debate on statistical practices in psychology.

In contrast to the original results, social power, operationalized by episodic priming, did not affect temporal discounting. A possible explanation is the fact that the power priming failed to elevate participants' sense of power.

Participants studied text passages and then either reread them three times or went through three cycles of cued recall questions (i.e., retrieval practice) with feedback. As in (lutler's (2010) experiment, an advantage of retrieval practice on the final far transfer test emerged after 1 week. Additionally, we observed an advantage of retrieval practice on the final test administered after 5 min. However, these advantages might have been due to participants in the retrieval practice condition receiving focused exposure to the key information (i.e., the feedback) that was needed to answer the final test questions. We therefore conducted a second experiment in which we included the retrieval practice condition and the reread condition from our first experiment, as well as a new reread-plus-statements condition. In the reread-plus-statements condition, participants received focused exposure to the key information after they had reread a text. As in Experiment 1, we found a large effect on far transfer when retrieval practice was compared to rereading. However, this effect was substantially reduced when retrieval practice was compared to the reread-plus-statements condition.

Across 59 countries and 12 personality (Big-5) and attitudinal variables we found that differences between students and general public were partly substantial, incoherent, and contradicted previous findings. Two often used cultural variables, embeddedness and intellectual autonomy, failed to explain the differences between both groups across countries. We further found that students vary as much as the general population both between and within countries.

First, I identify experimental replications and systematic aggregation of evidence (meta-analysis) as the self-corrective mechanism. Then, I present a computer simulation study of scientific communities that implement this mechanism to argue that frequentist statistics may converge upon a correct estimate or not depending on the social structure of the community that uses it. Based on this study, I argue that methodological explanations of the ""replicability crisis"" in psychology are limited and propose an alternative explanation in terms of biases. Finally, I conclude suggesting that scientific self-correction should be understood as an interaction effect between inference methods and social structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent retractions and failed replication attempts have led to a division in the field between proponents and skeptics and have reinforced the importance of confirming certain priming effects through replication. In this study, we describe the results of 2 preregistered replication attempts of 1 experiment by Forster and Denzler (2012). In both experiments, participants first processed letters either globally or locally, then were tested using a typicality rating task. Bayes factor hypothesis tests were conducted for both experiments: Experiment 1 (N = 100) yielded an indecisive Bayes factor of 1.38, indicating that the in-lab data are 1.38 times more likely to have occurred under the null hypothesis than under the alternative. Experiment 2 (N = 908) yielded a Bayes factor of 10.84, indicating strong support for the null hypothesis that global priming does not affect participants' mean typicality ratings.

We begin by presenting content analysis of the flag's prevalence in 2012 U.S. presidential campaign ads, which suggests both candidates saw flags as advantageous. Then, in two experiments set during the 2012 campaign and a later study with prospective 2016 candidates, we find flag exposure provides modest but consistent benefits for Republican candidates among voters high in symbolic patriotism, racial prejudice, and Republican identification. These effects arise regardless of which candidate appears with the flag. Taken together, our results speak to both the power and limitations of the American flag in electioneering.

Ideally, one achieves fame and impact in science by synthesizing two extreme career prototypes: intrinsic and extrinsic research. The former is guided by interest, curiosity, passion, gut, and intuition for important untapped topics. The latter is guided by money, grants, and/or what is being published in top-tier journals. Assessment of fame and impact in science ultimately rests on productivity (publication) and some variation of its impact (citations). In addition to those traditional measures of impact, there are some relatively new metrics (e.g., the h index and altmetrics). If psychology is to achieve consensual cumulative progress and better rates of replication, I propose that upcoming psychologists would do well to understand that success is not equal to fame and that individual career success is not necessarily the same as disciplinary success. Finally, if one is to have a successful and perhaps even famous career in psychological science, a good strategy would be to synthesize intrinsic and extrinsic motives for one's research.",,"[Feist, Gregory J.] San Jose State Univ, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Feist, Gregory J.] San Jose State Univ, Dept Psychol, One Washington Sq, San Jose, CA 95192 USA",,,,,,,,13,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000389721300009,

Kidd and Castano (2013) received a great deal of attention by providing support for this claim. Their article reported that reading segments of literary fiction (but not popular fiction or nonfiction) immediately and significantly improved performance on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), an advanced theory-of-mind test. Here we report a replication attempt by 3 independent research groups, with 792 participants randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions (literary fiction, popular fiction, nonfiction, and no reading). In contrast to Kidd and Castano (2013), we found no significant advantage in RMET scores for literary fiction compared to any of the other conditions. However, as in Kidd and Castano and previous research, the Author Recognition Test, a measure of lifetime exposure to fiction, consistently predicted RMET scores across conditions. We conclude that the most plausible link between reading fiction and theory of mind is either that individuals with strong theory of mind are drawn to fiction and/or that a lifetime of reading gradually strengthens theory of mind, but other variables, such as verbal ability, may also be at play.",,"[Panero, Maria Eugenia; Brownell, Hiram; Winner, Ellen] Boston Coll, Dept Psychol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Weisberg, Deena Skolnick] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, 425 South Univ Ave,Stephen A Levin Bldg, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Black, Jessica; Barnes, Jennifer L.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Psychol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Goldstein, Thalia R.] Pace Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10038 USA; [Weisberg, Deena Skolnick] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, 425 South Univ Ave,Stephen A Levin Bldg, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,,,,,,,53,,,,,,,"Psychology, Social",WOS:000386925600001,

The current paper fails to replicate this originally unpredicted interaction, which it initially codes as a failure (Table 3), but significantly replicates the main effect of the credentials manipulation as an ""added effect.""

The assumption of a universal pan-Asian holistic attentional bias has recently been challenged in experimental research involving Japanese and Chinese participants, which suggests that linguistic factors may contribute to the formation of East Asians' holistic attentional patterns. The present experimental research explores differences in attention and information processing styles between Korean and Chinese speakers, who have been assumed to display the same attentional bias due to cultural commonalities. We hypothesize that the specific structure of the Korean language predisposes speakers to pay more attention to ground information than to figure information, thus leading to a stronger holistic attentional bias compared to Chinese speakers. Findings of the present research comparing different groups of English, Chinese, and Korean speakers provide further evidence for differences in East Asians' holistic attentional bias, which may be due to the influence of language. Furthermore, we also extend prior theorizing by discussing the potential impact of other cultural factors.

In two studies, we investigated two factors that are expected to play a significant role in global judgments of perceived inflation: product accessibility and attitudes towards inflation. In Study 1 (N = 253), primed participants retrieved five products whose prices had increased (or decreased) in the past year before expressing a judgment of past inflation (versus non-primed participants with no retrieval task). In Study 2 (N = 101) participants were merely exposed to a series of products, and asked to estimate their frequency of purchase, before judging past inflation. In one condition, the prices of the majority of products had actually increased in the last year, while in another condition they had decreased. In both studies, attitudes towards inflation were also measured. Product priming consistently affected inflation judgments in the direction of an assimilation effect. Also, more negative attitudes towards inflation were associated with higher judgments of perceived inflation. Path analysis confirmed that both product accessibility and attitudes are potential bases for judgments of perceived inflation.

Such efforts are resource intensive and are sometimes controversial (with accusations of researcher incompetence) when a replication fails to show a previous result. An alternative approach is to examine the statistical properties of the reported literature to identify some cases of poor science. This review discusses some details of this process for prominent findings about racial bias, where a set of studies seems ""too good to be true."" This kind of analysis is based on the original studies, so it avoids criticism from the original authors about the validity of replication studies. The analysis is also much easier to perform than a new empirical study. A variation of the analysis can also be used to explore whether it makes sense to run a replication study. As demonstrated here, there are situations where the existing data suggest that a direct replication of a set of studies is not worth the effort. Such a conclusion should motivate scientists to generate alternative experimental designs that better test theoretical ideas.",,"[Francis, Gregory] Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Francis, Gregory] Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000383661200001,

Given certain necessary information about a research area, the model can be used to determine the optimal values of sample size, statistical power, rate of false positives, rate of false negatives, and replicability, such that overall research payoff is maximized. More specifically, the model shows how the optimal values of these quantities depend upon the size and frequency of true effects within the area, as well as the individual payoffs associated with particular study outcomes. The model is particularly relevant within current discussions of how to optimize the productivity of scientific research, because it shows which aspects of a research area must be considered and how these aspects combine to determine total research payoff.",,"[Miller, Jeff] Univ Otago, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Ulrich, Rolf] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany; [Miller, Jeff] Univ Otago, Dept Psychol, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",,,,,,,,18,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000385404300008,

Our simulation covers both restrictive settings as well as more realistic settings and proceeds across multiple metrics that assess different aspects of model performance. This evaluation is timely in light of two recently proposed approaches, the so-called p-curve and p-uniform approaches, that can be viewed as alternative implementations of the original Hedges selection method approach. We find that the p-curve and p-uniform approaches perform reasonably well but not as well as the original Hedges approach in the restrictive setting for which all three were designed. We also find they perform poorly in more realistic settings, whereas variants of the Hedges approach perform well. We conclude by urging caution in the application of selection methods: Given the idealistic model assumptions underlying selection methods and the sensitivity of population average effect size estimates to them, we advocate that selection methods should be used less for obtaining a single estimate that purports to adjust for publication bias ex post and more for sensitivity analysisthat is, exploring the range of estimates that result from assuming different forms of and severity of publication bias.",,"[McShane, Blakeley B.; Bockenholt, Ulf] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Hansen, Karsten T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [McShane, Blakeley B.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Donald P Jacobs Ctr, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,,,,,,,110,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000385404300012,

In this article, we ask whether there is a third way: can inattentive respondents be induced to pay attention? Using three different strategies across three studies, we show that while such inducements increase attention check passage, they do not reduce noise in descriptive or experimental survey items. In addition, the inducements cause some respondents to drop out of the survey. These results have important implications for applied research. While scholars should continue to measure inattention via attention checks, increasing the attentiveness of ""shirker"" respondents is not as easy as previously thought. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the present paper, I propose an alternative system for conducting rigorous and replicable psychological investigations, which I describe as Exploring Small, Confirming Big. I begin with a critical evaluation of the merits of NHST and small-scale meta-analyses, and argue that NHST does have a valuable role in the scientific process, whereas small-scale meta-analyses will do little to advance a cumulative science. I then present an overview of an alternative system for producing cumulative and replicable psychological research: Exploring Small, Confirming Big. It involves a two-step process to psychological research, consisting of (1) small N investigation(s), in which psychologists use NHST to develop exploratory models; and (2) strong, confirmatory tests of exploratory models, by analyzing new and/or existing large N datasets with variables that capture the effect(s) of interest from the Exploring Small stage. I conclude by discussing several anticipated benefits and challenges of adopting the Exploring Small, Confirming Big approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To reflect this understanding, we collected and summarized the existing literature on replications and combined it into a comprehensive overall typology that simplifies and restructures existing approaches. The resulting typology depicts how multiple, hierarchically structured replication studies guide the integration of laboratory and field research and advance theory. It can be applied to (a) evaluate a theory's current status, (b) guide researchers' decisions, (c) analyze and argue for the necessity of certain types of replication studies, and (d) assess the added value of a replication study at a given state of knowledge. We conclude with practical recommendations for different protagonists in the field (e.g., authors, reviewers, editors, and funding agencies). Together, our comprehensive typology and the related recommendations will contribute to an enhanced replication culture in social psychology and to a stronger real-world impact of the discipline.

Ioannidis claim is valid only for one-shot studies without replication and with a low a priori probability that the tested hypothesis is true. Mass replication provides limited information about the validity of social psychological research, because failures to replicate do not prove that the original finding is invalid.

Invalid data can be present in such data collections for a number of reasons. One reason is careless or insufficient effort (C/IE) responding. The past decade has seen a rise in research on techniques to detect and remove these data before normal analysis (Huang, Curran, Keeney, Poposld, & DeShon, 2012; Johnson, 2005; Meade & Craig, 2012). The rigorous use of these techniques is valuable tool for the removal of error that can impact survey results (Huang, Liu,.& Bowling, 2015). This research has encompassed a number of sub-fields of psychology, and this paper aims to integrate different perspectives into a review and assessment of current techniques, an introduction of new techniques, and a generation of recommendations for practical use.

The effects of intranasally administered oxytocin compared to placebo on brain neural activity have been supported in animal studies and in human studies of neural resting state. In several studies, oxytocin sniffs have been shown to lead to down-regulation of amygdala activation in response to infant attachment vocalisations. Meta-analytic evidence shows that oxytocin enhances the salience of (emotional) stimuli, lowers stress and arousal, and elevates empathic concern and tender care, in particular for offspring and in-group members. Less firm evidence points at the amnestic effects of oxytocin. We also note that the average effect sizes of oxytocin experiments are small to modest, and that most studies include a small number of subjects and thus are seriously underpowered, which implies a high risk for publication bias and nonreplicability. Nevertheless, we argue that the power of within-subjects experiments with oxytocin has been underestimated. Much more work is needed, however, to create a firm knowledge base of the neural and behavioural effects of oxytocin. Human oxytocin research is still taking place in the context of discovery, in which bold conjectures are being generated. In the context of justification, these conjectures should subsequently be subjected to stringent attempts at refutations before we jump to theoretical or clinical conclusions. For this context of justification, we propose a multisite multiple replications project on the social stimuli salience enhancing effect of oxytocin. Clinical application of oxytocin is premature. Meta-analytically, the use of oxytocin in clinical groups tends to show only effectiveness in changing symptomatology in individuals with autism spectrum disorders but, even then, it is not yet a validated therapy and its use is premature because safety and long-term side-effects have not been sufficiently studied, in particular in children.",,"[van IJzendoorn, M.

Few studies have empirically examined its underlying factor structure.Aims: This study (1) examines the factor structure of social cognition in both a sample of individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and non-clinical controls and (2) explores relationships of factors to neurocognition, symptoms and functioning.Method: A factor analysis was conducted on social cognition measures in a sample of 65 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and 50 control participants. The resulting factors were examined for their relationships to symptoms and functioning.Results: Results suggested a two-factor structure in the schizophrenia sample (social cognition skill and hostile attributional style) and a three-factor structure in the non-clinical sample (hostile attributional style, higher-level inferential processing and lower-level cue detection). In the schizophrenia sample, the social cognition skill factor was significantly related to negative symptoms and social functioning, whereas hostile attributional style predicted positive and general psychopathology symptoms.Conclusions: The factor structure of social cognition in schizophrenia separates hostile attributional style and social cognition skill, and each show differential relationships to relevant clinical variables in schizophrenia.",,"[Buck, Benjamin E.; Healey, Kristin M.; Gagen, Emily C.; Penn, David L.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychol, Davie Hall,CB 3270, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Roberts, David L.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Penn, David L.] Australian Catholic Univ, Sch Psychol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Buck, Benjamin E.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychol, Davie Hall,CB 3270, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",,,,,,,,35,,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical",WOS:000387800900008,

The latest meta-analysis by Oswald et al. (2013) suggests a very weak association. In the present meta-analysis, we switched the focus from the predictor to the criterion, by taking a closer look at the discrimination outcomes. We discovered that many of these outcomes were not actually operationalizations of discrimination, but rather of other related, but distinct, concepts, such as brain activity and voting preferences. When we meta-analyzed the main effects of discrimination among the remaining discrimination outcomes, the overall effect was close to zero and highly inconsistent across studies. Taken together, it is doubtful whether the amalgamation of these outcomes is relevant criteria for assessing the IAT's predictive validity of discrimination. Accordingly, there is also little evidence that the IAT can meaningfully predict discrimination, and we thus strongly caution against any practical applications of the IAT that rest on this assumption. However, provided that the application is thoroughly informed by the current state of the literature, we believe the IAT can still be a useful tool for researchers, educators, managers, and students who are interested in attitudes, prejudices, stereotypes, and discrimination.",,"[Carlsson, Rickard; Agerstrom, Jens] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Psychol, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden; [Carlsson, Rickard] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Psychol, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden",,,,,,,,31,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000379940000002,

Participants watched a sequence of silent videos depicting a magician performing with a single object. Following each video, participants were asked to write a description of the events in the video. In the final video, participants watched the Phantom Vanish Magic Trick, a novel magic trick developed for this experiment, in which the magician pantomimed the actions of presenting an object and then making it magically disappear. No object was presented during the final video. The silent videos precluded the use of false verbal suggestions, and participants were not asked leading questions about the objects. Nevertheless, 32% of participants reported having visual impressions of non-existent objects. These findings support an inferential model of perception, wherein top-down expectations can be manipulated by the magician to generate vivid illusory experiences, even in the absence of corresponding bottom-up information.",,"[Tompkins, Matthew L.; Davies, Anne M.

By means of a randomized survey experiment, we investigate whether or not increasing the number of providers of public services in the US electricity sector has detrimental effects on peoples' motivation to switch their provider after a service failure. We randomly varied the number of service providers in a hypothetical service failure scenario. Results show that increasing provider choice reduces people's likelihood of stating that they would switch away from a poor performing provider by 10% points. These findings also hold when replicating the experiment with an independent online sample. Thus our results indicate that increasing provider choice in public service markets reduces peoples' motivation to switch away from poor performing public services. In turn, this may lead to a situation where citizens become locked-in to a suboptimal provider simply due to an overload of choices.

In contrast, self-control failure is linked to maladaptive outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which self-control predicts behavior may assist in promoting better regulation and outcomes. A popular approach to understanding self-control is the strength or resource depletion model. Self-control is conceptualized as a limited resource that becomes depleted after a period of exertion resulting in self-control failure. The model has typically been tested using a sequential-task experimental paradigm, in which people completing an initial self-control task have reduced self-control capacity and poorer performance on a subsequent task, a state known as ego depletion. Although a meta-analysis of ego-depletion experiments found a medium-sized effect, subsequent meta-analyses have questioned the size and existence of the effect and identified instances of possible bias. The analyses served as a catalyst for the current Registered Replication Report of the ego-depletion effect. Multiple laboratories (k = 23, total N = 2,141) conducted replications of a standardized ego-depletion protocol based on a sequential-task paradigm by Sripada et al. Meta-analysis of the studies revealed that the size of the ego-depletion effect was small with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) that encompassed zero (d = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.15].

Although any measurement of publication bias depends on the prior distribution of empirical relationships, we determine that published estimates in political science are on average substantially larger than their true value under a variety of reasonable choices for this prior. We also find that many published estimates have a false positive probability substantially greater than the conventional alpha = 0.05 threshold for statistical significance if the prior probability of a null relationship exceeds 50%.

For example, the Reproducibility Project, a large-scale replication attempt of 100 studies published in top psychology journals found that only 39% could be unambiguously reproduced. There is a growing consensus among scientists that the lack of reproducibility in psychology and other fields stems from various methodological factors, including low statistical power, researcher's degrees of freedom, and an emphasis on publishing surprising positive results. However, there is a contentious debate about the extent to which failures to reproduce certain results might also reflect contextual differences (often termed ""hiddenmoderators"") between the original research and the replication attempt. Although psychologists have found extensive evidence that contextual factors alter behavior, some have argued that context is unlikely to influence the results of direct replications precisely because these studies use the same methods as those used in the original research. To help resolve this debate, we recoded the 100 original studies from the Reproducibility Project on the extent to which the research topic of each study was contextually sensitive. Results suggested that the contextual sensitivity of the research topic was associated with replication success, even after statistically adjusting for several methodological characteristics (e.g.,statistical power, effect size). The association between contextual sensitivity and replication success did not differ across psychological subdisciplines. These results suggest that researchers, replicators, and consumers should bemindful of contextual factors that might influence a psychological process.

Our hypotheses were that anchors with lower numerical precision and anchor sources with lower credibility would have less impact on effort estimates. The results from three software project effort estimation experiments, with 381 software professionals, support previous findings about the relevance of anchoring effects to software effort estimation. However, we found no decrease in the anchoring effect with decreasing anchor precision or source credibility. This suggests that even implausible anchors from low-credibility sources can lead to anchoring effects, and that all kinds of misleading information potentially acting as estimation anchors in project estimation contexts should be avoided.

Specifically, if one decides whether to stop or continue a further replication experiment depending on the significance of the results in an internal meta-analysis, false-positive rates would increase beyond the nominal level.

Findings revealed a small behavioral priming effect (d(FE) = 0.332, d(RE) = 0.352), which was robust across methodological procedures and only minimally biased by the publication of positive (vs. negative) results. Theory testing analyses indicated that more valued behavior or goal concepts (e.g., associated with important outcomes or values) were associated with stronger priming effects than were less valued behaviors. Furthermore, there was some evidence of persistence of goal effects over time. These results support the notion that goal activation contributes over and above perception-behavior in explaining priming effects.

Unfortunately, vote counting is a poor strategy to assess the reliability of psychological findings because it neglects the impact of selection bias and questionable research practices. In the present comment, we show that a range of meta-analytic tools indicate irregularities in the money priming literature discussed by Rohrer et al. and Vohs, which all point to the conclusion that these effects are distorted by selection bias, reporting biases, or p-hacking. This could help to explain why money-priming effects have proven unreliable in a number of direct replication attempts in which biases have been minimized through preregistration or transparent reporting.

This disorganization leads to redundancy in development, divergent implementations of conceptually identical tasks, disorganized and error-prone code lacking documentation, and difficulty in replication. The ongoing reproducibility crisis in psychology and neuroscience research (Baker, 2015: Open Science Collaboration, 2015) highlights the urgency of this challenge: reproducible research in behavioral psychology is conditional on deployment of equivalent experiments. A large, accessible repository of experiments for researchers to develop collaboratively is most efficiently accomplished through an open source framework. Here we present the Experiment Factory, an open source framework for the development and deployment of web based experiments. The modular infrastructure includes experiments, virtual machines for local or cloud deployment, and an application to drive these components and provide developers with functions and tools for further extension. We release this infrastructure with a deployment (http://www.expfactory.org) that researchers are currently using to run a set of over 80 standardized web based experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Because MTurk is a population that learns, we hypothesized that MTurkers would be more attentive to instructions than are traditional subject pool samples. In three online studies, participants from MTurk and collegiate populations participated in a task that included a measure of attentiveness to instructions (an instructional manipulation check: IMC). In all studies, MTurkers were more attentive to the instructions than were college students, even on novel IMCs (Studies 2 and 3), and MTurkers showed larger effects in response to a minute text manipulation.

We also demonstrate this problem using as practical example the evaluation of the effect of malaria prevalence on economic growth between 1960 and 1996. These findings call recent studies into question that use the p-curve to infer that most published research findings are based on true effects in the medical literature and in a wide range of disciplines. p-values in observational research may need to be empirically calibrated to be interpretable with respect to the commonly used significance threshold of 0.05.

Because a recent behavioral study found that high visual perceptual load decreased detection sensitivity of simultaneous tones, we used a similar task (n = 28) to determine if high visual perceptual load would reduce the auditory MMN. Results suggested that perceptual load did not decrease the MMN. At face value, these nonsignificant findings may suggest that effects of perceptual load on the MMN are smaller than those of other demanding visual tasks. If so, effect sizes should differ systematically between the present and previous studies. We conducted a selective meta-analysis of published studies in which the MMN was derived from the EEG, the visual task demands were continuous and varied between high and low within the same task, and the task-irrelevant tones were presented in a typical oddball paradigm simultaneously with the visual stimuli. Because the meta-analysis suggested that the present (null) findings did not differ systematically from previous findings, the available evidence was combined. Results of this meta-analysis confirmed that demanding visual tasks reduce the MMN to auditory distracters. However, because the meta-analysis was based on small studies and because of the risk for publication biases, future studies should be preregistered with large samples (n > 150) to provide confirmatory evidence for the results of the present meta-analysis.

As a consequence, this information will be more likely to become the basis for the absolute judgment which will therefore be assimilated toward the anchor. However, if the activated information overlaps with information that is elicited by the absolute judgment itself, the preceding comparative judgment should not exert an incremental effect and should fail to result in an anchoring effect. The present studies find this result when the comparative judgment refers to a general category and the absolute judgment refers to a subset of the general category that was activated by the anchor value. For example, participants comparing the average annual temperature in New York City to a high 102 degrees F judged the average winter, but not summer temperature to be higher than participants making no comparison.

The popularity and novelty of the platform have spurred numerous methodological investigations, making it the most studied nonprobability sample available to researchers. This article summarizes what is known about MTurk sample composition and data quality with an emphasis on findings relevant to clinical psychological research.

Using a case study of a prominent narrative review of the behavioral priming literature (Bargh, Schwader, Hailey, Dyer, & Boothby, 2012), we show that narrative reviews run the risk of drawing a picture that tends to be too good to be true, when the effect-sizes of the papers cited in the narrative review are compared to meta-analyses of the respective topic.

Prior research has identified many factors that affect one's ToM ability, but little work has examined how different kinds of monetary incentives affect ToM ability. We ask: Does money affect ToM ability? If so, how does the effect depend on the structure of monetary incentives? How do the differences depend on gender? We hypothesize that money will affect ToM ability differently by gender: monetary rewards increase males' motivation to express ToM ability while simultaneously crowding out females' motivation. This prediction is confirmed in an experiment that varies the structure of monetary rewards for correct answers in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). RMET scores decrease for females and increase for males with individual payments, and this effect is stronger with competitively-structured payments. RMET scores do not significantly change when monetary earnings go to a charity. Whether money improves or hinders ToM ability, and, hence, success in social interactions, thus depends on the interaction of gender and monetary incentive structure.",,"[Ridinger, Garret; McBride, Michael] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Expt Social Sci Lab, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [McBride, Michael] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Expt Social Sci Lab, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,WOS:000366040000037,

In contrast, we have encouraged ""conceptual replications"" (replicating at the construct level but with different operationalization) and ""replications with extensions"", reflecting our interest in providing evidence on the external validity and generalizability of published findings. In particular, our belief is that this replication philosophy allows for both replication and the creation of new knowledge.

For example, activating one generally weakens the other. Since priming religion is known to increase moral behaviour and moral sensitivity, priming science might be expected to have the opposite effect. However, it was recently demonstrated that, on the contrary, science priming increases moral sensitivity as well. The present set of studies sought to replicate this effect and test two explanations for it. Study 1 used a sentence unscrambling task for implicitly priming the concept of science but failed to replicate its effect on moral sensitivity, presumably due to a ceiling effect. Study 2 replicated the effect with a new measure of moral sensitivity. Study 3 tested whether science-related words create this effect by activating the idea of secular authority or by activating analytic thinking. It was demonstrated that words related to secular authority, but not words related to analytic thinking, produced a similar increase in moral sensitivity. Religiosity level of the participants did not influence this basic finding. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that science as a secular institution has overtaken some of the functions of religion in modern societies.",,"[Yilmaz, Onurcan; Bahcekapili, Hasan G.] Dogus Univ, Dept Psychol, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Onurcan] Dogus Univ, Dept Psychol, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey",,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,WOS:000361043100046,

This particularly applies to meta-analyses that feature small studies, which are ubiquitous in psychology. Here we develop a new method for meta-analysis that deals with publication bias. This method, p-uniform, enables (a) testing of publication bias, (b) effect size estimation, and (c) testing of the null-hypothesis of no effect. No current method for meta-analysis possesses all 3 qualities. Application of p-uniform is straightforward because no additional data on missing studies are needed and no sophisticated assumptions or choices need to be made before applying it. Simulations show that p-uniform generally outperforms the trim-and-fill method and the test of excess significance (TES; Ioannidis & Trikalinos, 2007b) if publication bias exists and population effect size is homogenous or heterogeneity is slight. For illustration, p-uniform and other publication bias analyses are applied to the meta-analysis of McCall and Carriger (1993) examining the association between infants' habituation to a stimulus and their later cognitive ability (IQ). We conclude that p-uniform is a valuable technique for examining publication bias and estimating population effects in fixed-effect meta-analyses, and as sensitivity analysis to draw inferences about publication bias.",,"[van Assen, Marcel A.

Based on the Unconscious Thought Theory, it has been suggested that poor lie detection arises from the intrinsic limitations of conscious thinking and can be improved by facilitating the contribution of unconscious thought (UT). In support of this hypothesis, Reinhard et al. (2013) observed improved lie detection among participants engaging in UT. The present study aimed to replicate this UT advantage using a similar experimental procedure but with an important improvement in a key control condition. Specifically, participants judged the truthfulness of eight video recordings in three thinking modes: immediately after watching them or after a period of unconscious or conscious deliberation. Results from two experiments (combined N = 226) failed to reveal a significant difference in lie detection accuracy between the thinking modes, even after efforts were made to facilitate the occurrence of an UT advantage in Experiment 2. The results imply that the UT advantage in deception detection is not a robust phenomenon.",,"[Moi, Wen Ying; Shanks, David R.] UCL, Div Psychol & Language Sci, London WC1H 0AP, England; [Shanks, David R.] UCL, Div Psychol & Language Sci, 26 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AP, England",,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000360044400001,

In both studies, male fruit flies apparently curbed their mate-harming behaviours in the presence of a few familiar or related males, suggesting some form of cooperation mediated by kin selection. In one study, the reduction in agonistic behaviour by brothers apparently rendered them vulnerable to dramatic loss of paternity share when competing with an unrelated male. If these results are robust and generalizable, fruit flies could be a major new focus for the experimental study of kin selection and social evolution. In our opinion, however, the restrictive conditions required for male cooperation to be adaptive in this species make it unlikely to evolve. We investigated these phenomena in two different populations of D. melanogaster using protocols very similar to those in the two previous studies. Our experiments show no evidence for a reduction in mate harm based upon either relatedness or familiarity between males, and no reduction in male reproductive success when two brothers are in the presence of an unfamiliar, unrelated, 'foreign' male. Thus, the reduction of sexual conflict owing to male cooperation does not appear to be a general feature of the species, at least under domestication, and these contrasting results call for further investigation: in new populations, in the field and in the laboratory populations in which these phenomena have been reported.",,"[Chippindale, Adam K.; Berggren, Meredith; Alpern, Joshua H.

Hence, the authors predicted that money primes would boost system justification, social dominance, belief in a just world, and free market ideology, and found supportive evidence. Rohrer, Pashler, and Harris (2015) failed to replicate those effects. This article discusses the factors that predict priming effects, and particularly those pertinent to differences between Caruso et al. and Rohrer et al. Variations in a prime's meaning, the ease with which primed content comes to mind, the prime's motivational importance, and the ambiguity of the outcome situation influence the impact of the prime. Money priming experiments (totaling 165 to date, from 18 countries) point to at least 2 major effects. First, compared to neutral primes, people reminded of money are less interpersonally attuned. They are not prosocial, caring, or warm. They eschew interdependence. Second, people reminded of money shift into professional, business, and work mentality. They exert effort on challenging tasks, demonstrate good performance, and feel efficacious. Money priming is not the same as priming another popular means of exchange, credit cards, and can have bigger effects when there is an implied connection between the self and having money. The practical benefits of money have been studied by other disciplines for decades, and the time is now for psychologists to study the effects of merely being reminded of money.",,"[Vohs, Kathleen D.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Vohs, Kathleen D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Mkt, Carlson Sch Management 3 150, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,,,,,,,83,,,,,,,"Psychology, Experimental",WOS:000358693000004,

Our goal is to provide a starting point for the perception researcher who is keen on assessing this tool for their own research goals. Internet-based testing has several advantages over in-lab research, including the ability to reach a relatively broad set of participants and to quickly and inexpensively collect large amounts of empirical data, via services such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk or Prolific Academic. In many cases, the quality of online data appears to match that collected in lab research. Generally-speaking, online participants tend to be more representative of the population at large than those recruited for lab based research. There are, though, some important caveats, when it comes to collecting data online. It is obviously much more difficult to control the exact parameters of stimulus presentation ( such as display characteristics) with online research. There are also some thorny ethical elements that need to be considered by experimenters.

Psychological research has recently provided support for a negative effect of social class on prosocial behavior. However, research outside the field of psychology has mainly found evidence for positive or u-shaped relations. In the present research, we therefore thoroughly examined the effect of social class on prosocial behavior. Moreover, we analyzed whether this effect was moderated by the kind of observed prosocial behavior, the observed country, and the measure of social class. Across eight studies with large and representative international samples, we predominantly found positive effects of social class on prosociality: Higher class individuals were more likely to make a charitable donation and contribute a higher percentage of their family income to charity (32,090 >= N >= 3,957; Studies 1-3), were more likely to volunteer (37,136 >= N >= 3,964; Studies 4-6), were more helpful (N = 3,902; Study 7), and were more trusting and trustworthy in an economic game when interacting with a stranger (N = 1,421; Study 8) than lower social class individuals. Although the effects of social class varied somewhat across the kinds of prosocial behavior, countries, and measures of social class, under no condition did we find the negative effect that would have been expected on the basis of previous results reported in the psychological literature.

A pre-analysis plan pre-specifies in a precise way the analysis to be run before examining the data. A researcher can specify variables, data cleaning procedures, regression specifications, and so on. If the regressions are pre-specified in advance and researchers are required to report all the results they pre-specify, data-mining problems are greatly reduced. I begin by laying out the basics of what a statistical analysis plan actually contains so those researchers unfamiliar with it can better understand how it is done. In so doing, I have drawn both on standards used in clinical trials, which are clearly specified by the Food and Drug Administration, as well as my own practical experience from writing these plans in economics contexts. I then lay out some of the advantages of pre-specified analysis plans, both for the scientific community as a whole and also for the researcher. I also explore some of the limitations and costs of such plans. I then review a few pieces of evidence that suggest that, in many contexts, the benefits of using pre-specified analysis plans may not be as high as one might have expected initially. For the most part, I will focus on the relatively narrow issue of pre-analysis for randomized controlled trials.",,"MIT, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Olken, Benjamin A.] MIT, Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,,,,,,,62,,,,,,,Economics,WOS:000358723800004,

Laboratory experiments allow researchers to provide internal validity to any phenomena they examine. However, researchers must consider and address certain methodological concerns when conducting lab research. Before participants ever agree to participate, forces are beginning to affect how they will respond to experimental manipulations. These and additional concerns continue during and after the completion of the experiment, yet many researchers do not fully understand their implications. As serious as these issues have always been, the introduction of social media and Internet data collection only highlight the importance of understanding and addressing methodological issues in laboratory experiments. In the following article, we discuss potential methodological flaws in laboratory research, examine research relevant to these problems, review evidence that suggests problems actually do contaminate our data, and suggest areas for future research. We conclude by providing recommendations for eliminating or alleviating these problems in future research, considering the role of replication studies as a post-hoc means of detecting these issues, and apply our conclusions to experimental research performed outside or a laboratory.

In our commentary, we argue that the author presents an overly idealized review of the literature in support of the YIC principle. Furthermore, we point out that the dissimilar trends observed in social and cognitive psychology, with respect to published evidence of strong unconscious effects, can better be explained by the way how awareness is defined and measured in both research fields.

An initial article reported that priming abstract linguistic categories (adjectives) led to more global perceptual processing, whereas priming concrete linguistic categories (verbs) led to more local perceptual processing (Stapel & Semin, 2007). However, this report was compromised by data fabrication by the first author, so that it remains unclear whether or not linguistic category priming influences perceptual processing. To fill this gap in the literature, the present article reports 12.studies among Dutch and US samples examining the perceptual effects of linguistic category priming. The results yielded no evidence of linguistic category priming effects. These findings are discussed in relation to other research showing cultural variations in linguistic category priming effects (IJzerman, Saddlemyer, & Koole, 2014).

Measures of childhood SES (both objective and subjective) were positively correlated with BTAE magnitude, though less strongly and less consistently than measures of current subjective SES. Meta-analysis revealed all measures of chronic SES (with the exception of education) were significantly correlated with BTAE.

While this method has been successfully validated for various offline measures-grammaticality judgment or other forced-choice tasks-its use for mainstream psycholinguistic research remains limited. This is because psycholinguistic effects are often dependent on relatively small differences in response times, and there remains some doubt as to whether precise timing measurements can be gathered over the web. Here we show that three classic psycholinguistic effects can in fact be replicated using AMT in combination with open-source software for gathering response times client-side. Specifically, we find reliable effects of subject definiteness, filler-gap dependency processing, and agreement attraction in self-paced reading tasks using approximately the same numbers of participants and/or trials as similar laboratory studies.

We developed the Replicability and Meta-Analytic Suitability Inventory (RAMSI) to evaluate the descriptive adequacy of a sample of studies taken from current psychological literature. Authors described only about 30% of the sampling decisions necessary for self-correcting science. We suggest that a modified RAMSI can be used by authors to guide their written reports and by reviewers to inform editorial recommendations. Finally, we claim that when researchers do not describe their sampling decisions, both readers and reviewers may assume that those decisions do not matter to the outcome of the study, do not affect inferences made from the research findings, do not inhibit inclusion in meta-analyses, and do not inhibit replicability of the study.

However, effect sizes are rarely fixed in psychological research: Study design choices, such as the operationalization of the dependent variable or the treatment manipulation, the social context, the subject pool, or the time of day, typically cause systematic variation in the effect size. Ignoring this between-study variation, as standard power formulae do, results in assessments of power that are too optimistic. Consequently, when researchers attempting replication set sample sizes using these formulae, their studies will be underpowered and will thus fail at a greater than expected rate. We illustrate this with both hypothetical examples and data on several well-studied phenomena in psychology. We provide formulae that account for between-study variation and suggest that researchers set sample sizes with respect to our generally more conservative formulae. Our formulae generalize to settings in which there are multiple effects of interest. We also introduce an easy-to-use website that implements our approach to setting sample sizes.

Humans are utility seekers and the implementation of current change initiatives is hindered by high initial buy-in costs and insufficient expected utility. Open science tools interested in improving science should team up, to increase utility while lowering the cost and risk associated with engagement. The best way to realign individual and group motives will probably be to create one, centralized, easy to use, platform, with a profile, a feed of targeted science stories based upon previous system interaction, a sophisticated (public) discussion section, and impact metrics which use the associated data These measures encourage high quality review and other prosocial activities while inhibiting self-serving behavior.

In this article, we provide a practical introduction to recently developed statistical tools that can be used to deal with these uncertainties when performing and evaluating research. In Part 1, we discuss the importance of accurate and stable effect size estimates as well as how to design studies to reach a corridor of stability around effect size estimates. In Part 2, we explain how, given uncertain effect size estimates, well-powered studies can be designed with sequential analyses. In Part 3, we (a) explain what p values convey about the likelihood that an effect is true, (b) illustrate how the v statistic can be used to evaluate the accuracy of individual studies, and (c) show how the evidential value of multiple studies can be examined with a p-curve analysis. We end by discussing the consequences of incorporating our recommendations in terms of a reduced quantity, but increased quality, of the research output. We hope that the practical recommendations discussed in this article will provide researchers with the tools to make important steps toward a psychological science that allows researchers to differentiate among all possible truths on the basis of their likelihood.",,"[Lakens, Daniel] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Innovat Sci, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Evers, Ellen R.

Because this effect does not fit with Asch's Gestalt-view on impression formation and does not readily follow from the data presented in his original paper, the goal of the present study was to critically examine and replicate the studies of Asch's paper that are most relevant to the primacy-of-warmth effect. We found no evidence for a primacyof- warmth effect.

We conducted four high-powered replications (total N = 1,952) of this effect and found different results. A meta-analysis of original and replication studies finds the sex difference in younger samples (though with a smaller effect size), and no effect among older samples. Furthermore, we found attitude toward uncommitted sex to be a mediator (although not consistently in the same direction) between participant sex and relative distress between sexual and emotional infidelity. We hypothesize that the discrepancies between the original and replication studies may be due to changing cultural attitudes about sex across time.

New experimental tools and statistical techniques make it easier to routinely sample stimuli, and to appropriately treat them as random factors. We encourage researchers to get into the habit of including multiple versions of the content (e.g., stimuli or vignettes) in their designs, to increase confidence in cross-stimulus generalization and to yield more realistic estimates of effect size.
