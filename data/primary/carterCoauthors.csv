Replication attempts like this one are clearly valuable and will continue to inform our science. We discuss a number of lessons we have taken from the process related to the divide between direct and conceptual replication, and whether the data can inform our current theory regarding the original effect. In discussing these issues, we advocate for transparent flexibility in data analyses and the involvement of the original authors at every stage of the process.","[Ferguson, Melissa J.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Carter, Travis J.; Hassin, Ran R.] Colby Coll, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel","Ferguson, MJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Psychol, 230 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",MJF44@cornell.edu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,6,6,1,7,HOGREFE & HUBER PUBLISHERS,GOTTINGEN,"ROHNSWEG 25, D-37085 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY",1864-9335,2151-2590,NA,SOC PSYCHOL-GERMANY,Soc.

We suggest that when wanting and uncertainty are high and personal control is lacking, people may be more likely to help others, as if they can encourage fate's favor by doing good deeds proactively. Four experiments support this karmic-investment hypothesis. When people want an outcome over which they have little control, their donations of time and money increase (Experiments 1 and 2), but their participation in other rewarding activities does not (Experiment 1b). In addition, at a job fair, job seekers who feel the process is outside (vs. within) their control make more generous pledges to charities (Experiment 3). Finally, karmic investments increase optimism about a desired outcome (Experiment 4). We conclude by discussing the role of personal control and magical beliefs in this phenomenon.","[Converse, Benjamin A.] Univ Virginia, Frank Batten Sch Leadership & Publ Policy, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Converse, Benjamin A.] Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Risen, Jane L.; Carter, Travis J.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Converse, BA (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Frank Batten Sch Leadership & Publ Policy, Garrett Hall,POB 400893, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",converse@virginia.edu; jane.risen@chicagobooth.edu,NA,"Carter, Travis/0000-0003-4499-7300",NA,NA,NA,40,34,34,0,50,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,NA,NA,PSYCHOL SCI,Psychol.

Previous research (Carter & Gilovich, 2010; Van Boven & Gilovich, 2003) indicates that experiences, such as vacations and concerts, are more likely to do so than material possessions, such as clothes and electronic gadgets. The present research was designed to explore 1 potential explanation for this result, namely, that experiences tend to be more closely associated with the self than possessions. The authors first show that people tend to think of their experiential purchases as more connected to the self than their possessions. Compared with their material purchases, participants drew their experiential purchases physically closer to the self (Study 1), were more likely to mention them when telling their life story (Study 2), and felt that a purchase described in terms of its experiential, rather than its material, qualities would overlap more with their sense of who they are (Study 4). Participants also felt that knowing a person's experiential purchases, compared with their material purchases, would yield greater insight into that person's true self (Studies 3A-3C). The authors then show that the tendency to cling more closely to cherished experiential memories is connected to the greater satisfaction people derive from experiences than possessions (Study 5).","[Carter, Travis J.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Ctr Decis Res, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gilovich, Thomas] Cornell Univ, Dept Psychol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Carter, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Ctr Decis Res, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",Travis.Carter@ChicagoBooth.edu,NA,"Carter, Travis/0000-0003-4499-7300",NA,NA,NA,65,145,152,18,443,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,NA,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

We report that a brief exposure to the American flag led to a shift toward Republican beliefs, attitudes, and voting behavior among both Republican and Democratic participants, despite their overwhelming belief that exposure to the flag would not influence their behavior. In Experiment 1, which was conducted online during the 2008 U. S. presidential election, a single exposure to an American flag resulted in a significant increase in participants' Republican voting intentions, voting behavior, political beliefs, and implicit and explicit attitudes, with some effects lasting 8 months after the exposure to the prime. In Experiment 2, we replicated the findings more than a year into the current Democratic presidential term. These results constitute the first evidence that nonconscious priming effects from exposure to a national flag can bias the citizenry toward one political party and can have considerable durability.","[Carter, Travis J.] Univ Chicago, Ctr Decis Res, Booth Sch Business, Harper Ctr C74, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Ferguson, Melissa J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Psychol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Hassin, Ran R.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Psychol, Jerusalem, Israel; [Hassin, Ran R.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Study Rat, Jerusalem, Israel","Carter, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Ctr Decis Res, Booth Sch Business, Harper Ctr C74, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",travis.carter@chicagobooth.edu; mjf44@cornell.edu,NA,"Carter, Travis/0000-0003-4499-7300",NA,NA,NA,24,62,62,0,39,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,NA,NA,PSYCHOL SCI,Psychol.

As much as Americans may love their country and way of life, they do not always explicitly agree with the policies that best serve to bolster and perpetuate the nation, such as unyielding diplomatic stances, unilateral military action, or giving up civil liberties in exchange for security. How then does a country with such diverse explicit opinions maintain its national power structures and the support of the populace? System justification theory contends that members of a system have an implicit motive to justify and bolster that system (Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004). Based on recent work on the implicit nationalism, we argue that the types of information that become associated with the nation in memory are the same types of information that help bolster and perpetuate the American system. In the present study, we find that a subtle reminder of America increases system justification for those with some moderate exposure to the political media, regardless of their explicit ideology. We argue that the implicit activation of information associated with America ultimately serves a nationalistic function, and more broadly, the system justification motive.","[Carter, Travis J.; Ferguson, Melissa J.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Hassin, Ran R.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel","Carter, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Ctr Decis Res, Harper Ctr C74, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",Travis.Carter@ChicagoBooth.edu,NA,"Carter, Travis/0000-0003-4499-7300",NA,NA,NA,69,19,19,0,12,GUILFORD PUBLICATIONS INC,NEW YORK,"370 SEVENTH AVE, SUITE 1200, NEW YORK, NY 10001-1020 USA",0278-016X,NA,NA,SOC COGNITION,Soc.

We propose, however, that closeness can lead people to overestimate how well they communicate, a phenomenon we term the closeness-communication bias. In one experiment, participants who followed direction of a friend were more likely to make egocentric errors look at and reach for an object only they could see than were those who followed direction of a stranger. In two additional experiments, participants who attempted to convey particular meanings with ambiguous phrases overestimated their success more when communicating with a friend or spouse than with strangers. We argue that people engage in active monitoring of strangers' divergent perspectives because they know they must, but that they let down their guard and rely more on their own perspective when they communicate with a friend.

But why are experiences more satisfying? We propose that the evaluation of experiences tends to be less comparative than that of material possessions, such that potentially invidious comparisons have less impact on satisfaction with experiences than with material possessions. Support for this contention was obtained in 8 studies. We found that participants were less satisfied with their material purchases because they were more likely to ruminate about unchosen options (Study 1); that participants tended to maximize when selecting material goods and satisfice when selecting experiences (Study 2); that participants examined unchosen material purchases more than unchosen experiential purchases (Study 3); and that, relative to experiences, participants' satisfaction with their material possessions was undermined more by comparisons to other available options (Studies 4 and 5A), to the same option at a different price (Studies 5B and 6), and to the purchases of other individuals (Study 5C). Our results suggest that experiential purchase decisions are easier to make and more conducive to well-being.","[Carter, Travis J.; Gilovich, Thomas] Cornell Univ, Dept Psychol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Carter, TJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Psychol, 211 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",tjc38@cornell.edu,NA,"Carter, Travis/0000-0003-4499-7300",NA,NA,NA,45,179,187,6,91,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,NA,NA,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

In the second set the American or the Israeli flag was primed (or not) and prejudice toward African-Americans or Palestinians (respectively) was examined. The results of all experiments suggest that the implicit activation of national cues has far-reaching implications on political thought and behavior as well as on attitudes toward minorities.
