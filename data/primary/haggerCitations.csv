What is more, patterns of food consumption tend to exhibit marked diurnal/circadian variations in many parts of the world too. The question addressed in this review is what factors help to explain these temporal differences in food consumption. While it has been suggested that our nutritional needs may differ somewhat over the course of the day, cultural conventions, marketing-led interventions, atmospheric (e.g., think only of changes in ambient temperature and/or daily light levels), perceptual (i.e., threshold) and/or hedonic changes, as well as psychological factors have also been suggested to play a role. Taken together, though, the evidence reviewed here would appear to support the view that cultural and psychological factors, not to mention the ubiquitous influence of food marketing, may be the most important factors in terms of helping to explain why it is that so many of us choose to eat different foods at different times of the day. Relevant psychological factors here include everything from the purported depletion of self-restraint resources over the course of the day through to the fulfilment of different psychological needs (e.g., functional or hedonic) associated with different mealtimes. Given the unhealthy foods typically associated with breakfast in many western countries (e.g., think only of sugar-laden breakfast cereals), gaining a better understanding of the factors underpinning current temporal patterns of food consumption may potentially help those wanting to nudge consumers toward making healthier food choices in the future.",,"[Spence, Charles] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Anna Watts Bldg, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Spence, Charles] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Anna Watts Bldg, Oxford OX2 6GG, England",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,Food Science & Technology,WOS:000630943500002,

Until that has happened, we do not allow the literature to proceed to a mature stage. This procedure will elevate the scientific status of direct replication studies in science.

In a high-powered experiment (N = 719), participants worked on a primary (transcription) task of varying self-control demands (low, high) and length (2, 4, 8 min), followed by a secondary (Stroop) task with low and high self-control demanding trials. In addition to trait boredom, we measured effort, difficulty, tiredness, frustration, and boredom after the primary task and repeatedly during the secondary task. Effort, difficulty, tiredness, and frustration increased with the demand and duration of the primary task; however, without affecting performance in the secondary task. Importantly, participants rated both the primary and the secondary task as boring, and higher boredom at the state and the trait level was associated with lower effort and higher difficulty, tiredness, and frustration. During the secondary task, boredom increased steadily but was generally lower in more self-control demanding trials. Finally, boredom predicted performance in the secondary task.

To this end, we directly replicated Cialdini et al.'s (1975) door-in-the-face (DITF) technique according to which people's likelihood to comply with a target request increases after having turned down a larger request. Thereby, we put the reciprocal concessions theory-the original process explanation of the DITF technique-to a critical test. Overall, compliance rates in our replication were similarly high as those Cialdini et al. (1975) found 45 years ago. That is, participants were more likely to comply with a target request after turning down an extreme request than participants who were exposed to the target request only or to a similarly small request before being exposed to the target request. These findings support the idea that reciprocity norms play a crucial role in DITF strategies.

In line with the ego depletion hypothesis, subjects perceived longer lasting secondary tasks as more self-control demanding. Contrary to the ego depletion hypothesis, however, performance did neither suffer from prior self-control exertion, nor as a function of task duration.

Here I use the six properties of emotions that Elster has summarized to suggest how they show a need for changes in the science of motivation. The apparent adaptive purpose of emotions lies in their action tendencies - what they add to the cold calculation of advantage. Subjectively they stand out by their intrusiveness, the duration of which often has a half-life. Emotions each have a valence, which suggests that they are not only motivating but also motivated, an implication that requires re-examination of how negativity works. Emotions are also experienced as 'triggered', but are so malleable that triggering cannot mean a simple conditioned reflexiveness. Emotions are not only triggered - or motivated - by beliefs, but motivate beliefs in turn, and can be fed back on themselves in a 'wildfire' phenomenon. These feedback effects are further evidence against emotions being reflexive. With regard to the three great revolutions, I argue that enthusiasm differs from romantic love only in its object, and urgency comes from the dysphoria of using response suppression for self-control.

These include hypotheses that concern sampling error, experimental control, and operationalization. How a scientific hypothesis could be underdetermined in one of these ways depends on a scientific discipline's epistemic goals, theoretical development, material constraints, institutional context, and their interconnections. I illustrate how these apply to the case of psychological science. I then contrast this ""bottom-up"" account with ""top-down"" accounts, which assume that the role of replication in a particular science, such as psychology, must follow from a uniform role that it plays in science generally. Aside from avoiding unaddressed problems with top-down accounts, my bottom-up account also better explains the variability of importance of replication of various types across different scientific disciplines.",,"[Fletcher, Samuel C.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Philosophy, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Fletcher, Samuel C.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Philosophy, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,History & Philosophy Of Science,WOS:000608014000001,

Focusing on continuous outcome variables, we surveyed heterogeneity in 150 meta-analyses from cognitive, organizational, and social psychology and 57 multiple close replications. Heterogeneity proved to be very high in meta-analyses, with powerful moderators being conspicuously absent. Population effects in the average meta-analysis vary from small to very large for reasons that are typically not understood. In contrast, heterogeneity was moderate in close replications. A newly identified relationship between heterogeneity and effect size allowed us to make predictions about expected heterogeneity levels.

In this study, we sought to (a) examine if health care workers intensely involved in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are experiencing negative psychological and emotional outcomes, and (b) investigate if helping related factors (prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact) exacerbate and mitigate relationships to negative outcomes in a crisis situation. Using data collected from doctors and nurses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine the relationship between intensity of involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic response and emotional exhaustion and depression, as well as the moderating effects of prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact. Data was collected at three time points (T1 and T2 prepandemic, and T3 during COVID-19), with prosocial motivation and controls collected at T1/T2 and predictors and outcomes collected during the pandemic. We find that intensity of involvement does associate with emotional exhaustion at work and that higher prosocial motivation exacerbates this relationship. Supplemental analyses suggest that the exposure to self-dimension of involvement is positively associated with emotional exhaustion and depression.

There has been a proliferation of theories and models describing different aspects of self-regulation both within and outside of psychology. All of these models provide insights about self-regulation, but sometimes they talk past each other, make only shallow contributions, or make contributions that are underappreciated by scholars working in adjacent areas. The purpose of this article is to integrate across the many different models in order to refine the vast literature on self-regulation. To achieve this objective, we first review some of the more prominent models of self-regulation coming from social psychology, personality psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. We then integrate across these models based on four key elements-level of analysis, conflict, emotion, and cognitive functioning-specifically identifying points of convergence but also points of insufficient emphasis.

When actually experiencing (or predicting affective states for) only one of these options, people are usually in single evaluation (SE) mode where direct comparisons are more difficult. This situational difference in evaluation mode was observed to lead to overpredictions of positive affect (happiness) when people were in JE in comparison to SE for options that were quantitatively different, but there were no overpredictions for options that were qualitatively different. This effect was coined distinction bias. In the present paper, we replicated (and extended on) Studies 1 and 2 from Hsee and Zhang with 824 MTurk participants. In Study 1 we replicated the original findings: Relative to people in SE, people in JE overpredicted the happiness derived from quantitatively different hypothetical scenarios (i.e., selling 80 vs 160 books, or 160 vs 240 books), but did not overpredict the difference between qualitatively different hypothetical scenarios (i.e., selling 0 books vs 80 books; 0 being the implicit reference point that makes the two scenarios qualitatively different). Study 2 failed to find support for the original findings: People in JE did not consistently overpredict happiness for quantitatively different scenarios (i.e., copy-pasting 25 negative words vs 10 negative words, or 10 positive words vs 25 positive words).

Sustaining attention over extended periods of time relies on selfcontrol. Crucially, perceived state self-control strength appears to wane as a function of task duration, which ultimately can impair shooting performance. In the present study, we tested the assumption that the level of self reported self-control strength decreases over the course of a 1-h shooting task measured twice during a regular training day and separated by a 2-h break. Additionally, we assumed that shooting performance would be linked with fluctuations in self-control. A total of 21 shooters (14 elite and 7 sub-elite) took part in this study and were asked to perform a series of 10 shots at a standardized target, five times in the morning and five times in the afternoon (i.e., 100 shots total). The participants also reported their perceived state self-control strength at the baseline (prior to the start of the morning session as well as the afternoon session) and after a series of 10 shots each in the morning and afternoon (i.e., 12 measurements in total). In line with our hypotheses, we observed that perceived state self-control diminished with the number of shots performed, and that perceived state self-control could explain shooting performance. Additionally, these observations could explain the difference in shooting performance between elite and sub-elite athletes. The results suggest that the perception of self-control strength is highly important for optimal shooting performance.

Sixty-five frequent sports bettors (35 ""nonproblem bettors"" and 30 ""problem bettors"") were exposed to cues representing real upcoming sport events (with varying levels of winning confidence) that were made available or blocked for betting, during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recording. Sports betting passion and trait-self-control were assessed using self-report scales. Sport events nonavailable for betting elicited higher insular and striatal activation in problem bettors, as compared with nonproblem bettors. Within a large cluster encompassing the ventral striatum, hippocampus, and amygdala, lower trait-self-control was associated with increased brain reactivity to sport events with high levels of winning confidence that were nonavailable for betting.

Extending this literature, we focus on norm-transgressing behavior that is intended to primarily benefit others. In particular, we predicted a differing effect of self-regulatory resource depletion on dishonesty that benefits one's group, depending on the degree of identification with the group. Following a dual process approach, we argue that if identification with the group is strong, then people may have an automatic inclination to benefit their group even perhaps by lying. In contrast, if identification with the group is weak, then the default, uncontrolled impulse may be to tell the truth. Accordingly, identification with the social group should interact with self-regulatory resource depletion in predicting group-benefiting dishonesty. Focusing on pro-organizational dishonesty, we tested our hypotheses in one field study with 1269 employees and in one experimental study with 71 university students. As predicted, the results revealed a highly significant interaction of organizational identification and self-control strength: Depletion of self-regulatory resources increased the level of pro-organizational dishonesty among those who identify highly with the organization, but decreased the level of such behavior among those who identify less.",,"[Baur, Carolin] Univ Bremen, Bremen Int Grad Sch Social Sci BIGSSS, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Baur, Carolin] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Soucek, Roman] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Sch Business Econ & Soc, Nurnberg, Germany; [Kuehnen, Ulrich] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Dept Psychol & Methods, Bremen, Germany; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Baur, Carolin] Univ Bremen, Bremen Int Grad Sch Social Sci BIGSSS, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany; [Baur, Carolin] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,Business; Ethics,WOS:000598167500003,

Participants then completed self-report measures of trait self-control. The ego depletion group performed a written transcription task requiring self-control, while the control group transcribed the text normally. Before the public speaking task, participant's challenge and threat evaluations and subjective ratings of performance were assessed via self-report items. Results : The results of independent t-tests supported the effectiveness of the self-control manipulation. There were no significant differences between the ego depletion and control groups in terms of challenge and threat evaluations or subjective performance. Additional correlation analyses revealed that trait measures of self-control were significantly and negatively related to challenge and threat evaluations and subjective performance.

METHODS: While in the functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner, 25 cigarette smokers who abstained from smoking overnight made 200 real smoking decisions regarding whether or not to take a puff of an electronic cigarette during 3 different stress conditions (cognitive stress, emotional stress, and no stress). Cognitive stress was induced by a concurrent working memory load, and emotional stress was induced by manipulating a chance of aversive electric shock. RESULTS: Behaviorally, both cognitive and emotional stress manipulations increased the probability of making a decision to smoke (i.e., taking a puff). In magnetic resonance imaging trial-by-trial analyses, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity measured at the time of the stress cue significantly predicted future smoking decisions that occurred several seconds later. Furthermore, the influence of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity on smoking decisions was mediated by the ventral striatum activity at the time of smoking decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that brain responses at the time of a stressful moment determine subsequent trial-by-trial smoking decisions by systematically altering brain executive (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and reward (ventral striatum) system network activities. Our results further suggest potential translational importance of neuroscientific approaches to predicting self-regulation failures at critical stressful moments.",,"[Lim, Seung-Lark] Univ Missouri, Dept Psychol, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Catley, Delwyn] Childrens Mercy Kansas City, Ctr Childrens Hlth Lifestyles & Nutr, Kansas City, MO USA; [Martin, Laura E.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Dept Populat Hlth, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA; [Martin, Laura E.] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Hoglund Biomed Imaging Ctr, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA; [Martin, Laura E.] Univ Kansas, Cofrin Logan Ctr Addict Res & Treatment, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Lim, Seung-Lark] Univ Missouri, Dept Psychol, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,Neurosciences,WOS:000588636600005,

However, accommodation and inhibition may be difficult when self-control strength is weak or depleted by prior exertion of self-control. The present study considered whether state self-control depletion prospectively predicts male and female self-reports of anger with partner and arguing with partner. Consistent with the I(3)Model (Finkel, 2014,Adv Exp Soc Psychol, 49, 1-104), we also considered whether the association between elevated anger and arguing (i.e., instigation) and partner aggression was stronger when state self-control (i.e., inhibition) was depleted or among people high in negative urgency. In this ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study, heavy drinking married and cohabiting heterosexual couples (N = 191) responded to three randomly signaled reports each day for 30 days. Depletion predicted anger and arguing with partners both cross-sectionally and prospectively for men and women. However, after controlling for prior levels of anger and arguing, these effects were diminished, and supplemental analyses revealed that anger and arguing with partner predicted subsequent depletion.

We theorized that experiencing PTSD symptoms engenders efforts to regulate mood, control thoughts, and inhibit or control behavior that is taxing to the individual (i.e., it places demands on self-control) and hypothesized that this process results in subsequent deficits in regulatory control that manifest in heightened intoxication and conduct problems associated with PTSD. At the within-person level, daytime PTSD symptoms, IRR = 1.09, and self-control demands, IRR = 1.12, exhibited within-person associations with nighttime conduct problems over and above nighttime intoxication. Consistent with our hypothesis, daytime increases in self-control demands mediated the associations between daytime PTSD symptoms and subsequent nighttime conduct problems. The indirect effect between daytime PTSD symptoms and nighttime intoxication via self-control demands was nonsignificant. At the between-person level, self-control demands mediated the associations between PTSD symptoms and conduct problems; however, the expected between-person associations with intoxication were nonsignificant. Drinking behavior is related to but cannot fully account for various difficulties in psychosocial functioning associated with PTSD. The present results suggest that dysregulated behavior may, ironically, stem from individuals' concerted efforts to control and manage overwhelming symptoms.

The resulting non-homothetic feature of consumer preferences helps describe self-regulatory behavior in such an empirically relevant way that it depends on the nature of the tempting good (luxury or inferior) and on consumer wealth. First, richer consumers are more self-indulgent and impatient in consuming tempting luxuries, whereas less so in consuming tempting inferiors: impatience is marginally increasing in wealth for jewels whereas decreasing for junk foods. Second, self-control fatigue weakens implied patience for tempting good consumption. Third, upon a stressful shock, with the resulting increasing scarcity of willpower, self-indulgence and impatience for tempting good consumption increase over time.

Specifically, we demonstrate that targets with high levels of sensitivity to interpersonal mistreatment are more likely to experience ego depletion, and that targets with high levels of moral disengagement will find it easier to persuade themselves to engage in political acts. We conducted a three-wave time-lagged survey of 265 employees in Guangdong, China, to test our hypotheses.

This means that internal and external conditions fluctuate and are different in a replication study vs. the original. Thus, a replication experiment is just another empirical investigation in an ongoing effort to establish scientific truth. Neither the original nor a replication is the final arbiter of whether or not something exists. Discovered patterns need not be permanent laws of human behavior proven by the pinpoint statistical verification through replication.

Instead of measuring performance in the second task that is equally difficult for all participants, the present studies investigated effects of effortful exertion on the choice to willingly exert effort on a subsequent task. Three pre-registered studies investigated if participants select less effort demanding math problems for upcoming tasks compared to a control group after exerting mental effort in an initial task.

Furthermore, we examined the mediated effect of morning demands on job performance via start-of-work-time fatigue. Finally, we investigated whether work schedule flexibility and childcare drop-off time flexibility attenuated the adverse effect of morning demands on fatigue. The results indicated that morning childcare-related and commute-related demands had a significant indirect effect on job performance, as these morning demands predicted start-of-work-time fatigue, which in turn was associated with daily job performance. Work schedule flexibility, but not drop-off time flexibility, buffered the effect of morning demands on start-of-work-time fatigue. To enhance the job performance of working parents, future research should pay more attention to contextual factors before daily work starts.",,"[Dettmers, Jan] Fernuniv, Fac Psychol, Hagen, Germany; [Wendt, Carolin; Biemelt, Jana] MSH Med Sch Hamburg, Dept Psychol, Hagen, Germany; [Dettmers, Jan] Fernuniv, Fac Psychol, Hagen, Germany",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Applied; Management",WOS:000565367500001,

The first two visits involved measuring participants' maximal aerobic capacity and familiarized participants to the fixed power (FP) and 16.1 km cycling time trial (TT) tasks. The FP task required participants to cycle at 70% of their maximal aerobic power for 10-minutes. In the subsequent three visits, participants performed the FP and TT tasks after viewing pleasant, left-to-right markpainful or neutral images. Participants rated the subset of painful images as more painful than the pleasant and neutral images; with no difference in the pain ratings of the pleasant and neutral images. In the FP task, EIP ratings were higher following painful compared to pleasant images, while no differences in EIP were observed between any other condition . In the TT, performance did not differ between the pleasant and neutral conditions. However, TT performance was reduced after viewing painful images compared to neutral or pleasant images.

In an effort to achieve this, we integrate the concepts of self-control and self-management within the effort monitoring and regulation (EMR) framework laid out by de Bruin et al. (Educational Psychology Reviewthis issue). More specifically, we argue that (1) cognitive load results from how the instruction isprocessedand not just from how it is designed (cf. self-management effect). (2) How instruction is processed by students (also) depends on their skill and will to self-control. For instance, high self-control may reflect compensatory processing of poorer instructional designs so that these designs may not lead to higher extraneous cognitive load. As soon as students' willingness to self-control declines (e.g., with increasing study durations or previous demanding tasks), there is a closer link between (poorer) instructional designs and (higher) extraneous cognitive load in self-regulated learning tasks. Combining (1) and (2), we consider cognitive load to be influenced by self-control; (self-)control, in turn, is one central process of the monitoring-control cycle that characterizes self-regulated learning. We support these theoretical arguments by referring to empirical research in the domain of learning with multiple representations-with a particular focus on learning with and without seductive details during extended study episodes. We conclude with suggestions for further research.",,"[Eitel, Alexander] Univ Giessen, Dept Educ Psychol, D-35394 Giessen, Germany; [Endres, Tino; Renkl, Alexander] Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; [Eitel, Alexander] Univ Giessen, Dept Educ Psychol, D-35394 Giessen, Germany",,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,"Psychology, Educational",WOS:000554850000001,

A reactance decoy is a persuasive message presented before the target message and includes an attitude measurement toward the decoy object. The effect can be explained with reactance theory: The decoy message is presented to create reactance and expressing their attitude toward the decoy object gives participants the opportunity to vent, that is, to reestablish their threatened freedom. This reduces reactance toward the subsequently presented target message, positively influences participants' willingness to buy the target object (Studies 1, 4a and 4b, 7, and 8), their attitudes toward it (4a and 4b, 5, 7, and 8), their willingness to pay (Study 7), as well as behavioral measures such as time spent looking at the target object description (Study 7) and paying money to enter a raffle for the chance to win the target object (Studies 5 and 6). Moreover, forewarning participants of the persuasive intent of a subsequent message produced greater reactance, which was then vented on the decoy, and in turn increased the valuation of the target object (Study 1). By interchanging the products used as decoy or target objects, we also demonstrate experimentally that the reactance decoy effect occurs independently of the concrete stimuli being used (Study 3). In sum, the reactance decoy effect is a new theoretical framework that also bears important practical applications for many areas of social influence.",,"[Schumpe, Birga M.; Belanger, Jocelyn J.; Nisa, Claudia F.] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Dept Psychol, POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Schumpe, Birga M.] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Dept Psychol, POB 129188, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Social",WOS:000551440600004,

Though social decision-making research has blossomed in recent decades, surprisingly little is known about whether social decision-making preferences are consistent across different domains. We conducted an exploratory study in which participants made choices about 2 types of close others: parents and friends. To elicit decision making preferences, we pit the interests in parents and friends against one another. To assess the consistency of preferences for close others, decision making was assessed in three domains-risk taking, probabilistic learning. and self-other similarity judgments. We reasoned that if social decision-making preferences are consistent across domains, participants ought to exhibit the same preference in all three domains (i.e., a parent preference, based on prior work), and individual differences in preference magnitude ought to be conserved across domains within individuals. A combination of computational modeling, random coefficient regression, and traditional statistical tests revealed a robust parent-over-friend preference in the risk taking and probabilistic learning domains but not the self-other similarity domain. Preferences for parent-over-friend in the risk-taking domain were strongly associated with similar preferences in the probabilistic learning domain but not the self-other similarity domain.

The foundations of ego depletion have recently been questioned. Thus, although self-control is among the most researched psychological concepts with high societal relevance, an inconsistent body of literature limits our understanding of how self-control operates. Here, we propose that the inconsistencies are partly due to a confound that has unknowingly and systematically been introduced into the ego-depletion research: boredom. We propose that boredom might affect results of self-control research by placing an unwanted demand on self-control and signaling that one should explore behavioral alternatives. To account for boredom in self-controlled behavior, we provide a working model that integrates evidence from reward-based models of self-control and recent theorizing on boredom to explain the effects of both self-control exertion and boredom on subsequent self-control performance.

Bayes factor analyses revealed extreme evidence supporting the alternative hypothesis that the mental fatigue task was more mentally fatiguing than the control task, BF01= 0.009.

Our data seem to challenge the idea that mental fatigue has a negative influence on exercise performance. Although we did succeed at manipulating subjective mental fatigue, this did not impair physical performance.

Infants are a hard-to-reach population, usually yielding small sample sizes, they can only complete a limited number of trials, and they can be excluded based on hard-to-predict complications (e.g., parental interference, fussiness). In addition, as effects themselves potentially change with age and population, it is hard to calculate an a priori effect size. At the same time, these very factors make preregistration in infant studies a valuable tool. A priori examination of the planned study, including the hypotheses, sample size, and resulting statistical power, increases the credibility of single studies and adds value to the field.

In 2 studies, public-facing employees completed multiple assessments per day for 2 weeks. Study 1 showed that surface acting had no direct or indirect effect on alcohol use via depletion, nor via negative mood as an alternative measure of depletion. Study 2 demonstrated that surface acting directly increased subsequent drinking only for those with high emotional demands, but not through depletion. Across both studies, daily deep acting (i.e., modifying emotions to feel positive) consistently predicted less alcohol consumption, but this did not occur through depletion. Study 2 provided evidence for an alternative, motivational shift explanation-a reduced motive to detach from work after regulating by deep acting-rather than self-control capacity.

I refer to this variant of psychology as connected because the emphasis is on connecting various research findings and ideas generated by different scholars (e.g., by showing how they are related to each other via referencing). In this article, I argue that, although connected psychology advances psychological knowledge, it restricts the total amount of knowledge that could eventually be produced and therefore limits the potential of the discipline to improve the understanding of psychological phenomena. As a solution, I propose that, alongside the currently existing connected psychology, disconnected psychology should be established. In disconnected psychology, researchers develop their ideas by following the main principles of psychological method, but they are disconnected from a ""field"" consisting of other psychologists and therefore do not follow the discipline's norms and conventions. By drawing on one of the core constructs from information theory-information entropy-I argue that combining the two streams of psychology would result in the most significant advancement of psychological knowledge.",,"[Krpan, Dario] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Krpan, Dario] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000532759000001,

One reason may be a lack of easily applicable methods for planning studies to achieve sufficiently tight confidence intervals. This paper presents tables and freely accessible tools to facilitate planning studies for the desired accuracy in parameter estimation for a common effect size (Cohen's d). In addition, the importance of such accuracy is demonstrated using data from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (RPP). Results: It is shown that the sampling distribution of Cohen's d is very wide unless sample sizes are considerably larger than what is common in psychology studies. This means that effect size estimates can vary substantially from sample to sample, even with perfect replications. The RPP replications' confidence intervals for Cohen's d have widths of around 1 standard deviation (95% confidence interval from 1.05 to 1.39). Therefore, point estimates obtained in replications are likely to vary substantially from the estimates from earlier studies.

The results supported the effectiveness of the self-control manipulation, with the experimental group transcribing fewer words, making more errors, and regulating their writing habits more than the control group. Although there were no differences between the groups in terms of muscular endurance performance or challenge and threat states, there was a significant interaction of Time (Pre vs. Post) x Group (Experimental vs. Control) in cerebral perfusion.

In psychology, the principal reason for retraction was data fabrication. Retractions took longer to make, and generally were from higher ranked and more prestigious journals, than in the two cognate disciplines. We recommend that journal editors should be more forthcoming in the reasons they provide for article retractions. We also recommend that the discipline of psychology gives a greater priority to the publication of replication studies; initiates a debate about how to respond to failed replications; adopts a more critical attitude to the importance of attaining statistical significance; discourages p-hacking and Hypothesizing After Results are Known (HARKing); assesses the long-term effects of pre-registering research; and supports stronger procedures to attest to the authenticity of data in research papers.

Research shows that holding a nonlimited-resource belief prevents individuals from suffering ego depletion and is related to successful self-regulation. The current study explored how personality, time perspective, and intelligence predict willpower theories. Additionally, two aspects of willpower theories, strenuous mental activity and resistance to temptations, were measured separately. The results indicated that the two aspects of willpower theories were not correlated with each other. This supports hypothesis that willpower theories may be domain specific and also suggests that these two aspects should not be aggregated into one, homogenous scale as was done in some previous research. Both aspects of holding a nonlimited-resource theory were related positively to emotional stability and negatively to past negative time perspective. Strenuous mental activity was positively associated with intellect and negatively with present fatalism, whereas resistance to temptations was correlated positively with conscientiousness and future time perspective.

Ninety participants were randomly assigned to a 2 (attitude measure: before vs after) x 2 (alcohol portrayal: yes vs no) x 2 (ego depletion: yes vs no) mixed design to assess whether the effects of alcohol portrayals affected cognitive resources. It was hypothesized that alcohol portrayals would have more of an impact on participants submitted to an ego-depletion task. We found a change in attitudes toward alcohol only for participants that had been exposed to alcohol portrayals, and who had not been cognitively depleted. These results suggest that these changes rely on controlled, resource-dependent processes rather than on purely associative and automatic processes.

This study sought to expand the previous literature by prompting emotion and emotion suppression and measuring their impact on delay discounting, a theoretically derived measure of self-control. Adult undergraduates (n = 179) were exposed to one of three manipulations of affect (i.e., positive, neutral, and negative) using previously validated film clips. Half of these participants were instructed to suppress their emotional responses to the film clips. Following the film clips, all participants completed the delay discounting task. There were no main effects of specific emotions on delay discounting. There was a significant main effect for suppression group on delay discounting such that the suppression of emotion was accompanied by higher rates of self-control using the delay discounting task. The findings suggest, contrary to our expectation, that the suppression of emotion leads to short-term increases in self-control measured using the delay discounting task.

Effortful thinking has been shown to help reduce anchoring effects, in which people form social judgments by adjusting from an initial value (the anchor). We therefore predicted that ego depletion would reduce the amount of adjustment from an initial anchor, leaving the final judgment relatively close to the anchor value. In contrast to previous research by Banker et al. (2017), we excluded alternative explanations, such as social mechanisms. In particular, we tested adjustment from internally generated and externally provided anchors. We theorized that judgment adjustment processes are the same for both internal and external cues. The results showed that neither self-generated nor experimenter-provided anchors were affected by ego depletion, thus leaving social mechanisms as the prime alternative explanation. The data also showed that susceptibility to anchoring is not a trait because reactions to different anchors were not substantially intercorrelated. Further, providing externally or internally generated anchors did not make a fundamental difference. However, the loss of data was higher with self-generated anchors.

For example, in order to remember an upcoming appointment one might rely on unaided memory or create a reminder by setting a smartphone alert. Setting a reminder incurs both a cost (the time/effort to set it up) and a benefit (increased likelihood of remembering). Here we investigate whether individuals weigh such costs/benefits optimally or show systematic biases. In 3 experiments, participants performed a memory task where they could choose between (a) earning a maximum reward for each remembered item, using unaided memory; or (b) earning a lesser amount per item, using external reminders to increase the number remembered. Participants were significantly biased toward using external reminders, even when they had a financial incentive to choose optimally. Individual differences in this bias were stable over time, and predicted by participants' erroneous metacognitive underconfidence in their memory abilities. Bias was eliminated, however, when participants received metacognitive advice about which strategy was likely to maximize performance. Furthermore, we found that metacognitive interventions (manipulation of feedback valence and practice-trial difficulty) yielded shifts in participants' reminder bias that were mediated by shifts in confidence. However, the bias could not be fully attributed to metacognitive error. We conclude that individuals have stable biases toward using external versus internal cognitive resources, which result at least in part from inaccurate metacognitive evaluations.

However, not all studies, especially those with null findings, make it to formal publication. This publication bias towards positive findings may contribute to questionable research practices. Preregistration is a solution to prevent the publication of distorted evidence resulting from this system. This process asks authors to register their hypotheses and methods before data collection on a publicly available repository or by submitting a Registered Report. In the Registered Report format, authors submit a stage 1 manuscript to a participating journal that includes an introduction, methods, and any pilot data indicating the exploratory or confirmatory nature of the study. After a stage 1 peer review, the manuscript can then be offered in-principle acceptance, rejected, or sent back for revisions to improve the quality of the study. If accepted, the project is guaranteed publication, assuming the authors follow the data collection and analysis protocol. After data collection, authors re-submit a stage 2 manuscript that includes the results and discussion, and the study is evaluated on clarity and conformity with the planned analysis. In its final form, Registered Reports appear almost identical to a typical publication, but give readers confidence that the hypotheses and main analyses are less susceptible to bias from questionable research practices.

Alcoholics Anonymous has long claimed that individuals can allay alcohol cravings by eating sweets. Empirical tests of this strategy are limited to a few preclinical studies in rats, and there is no existing experiment testing the acute effect of eating sweets on alcohol cravings in humans. Purpose The current study sought to experimentally test the acute effect of eating sweets on alcohol cravings in a sample with at-risk drinking. Methods After being exposed to an alcohol cue, individuals with at-risk drinking (N = 150) were randomly assigned to eat sweets (n = 60), eat calorie-equivalent bland food (n = 60), or watch a video (n = 30). Caloric amounts were manipulated. Individuals with at-risk drinking were then exposed to a second alcohol cue. Changes in alcohol cravings from after the first to after the second alcohol cue were measured via visual analog scale and heart rate. Results There were no significant between-group differences in changes in alcohol cravings. Caloric amounts did not modify effects. Conclusions Experimental findings did not provide evidence to support the clinical lore that eating sweets can reduce alcohol cravings, albeit only acutely and for those with at-risk drinking.

As fatigue effects have been typically demonstrated after long hours of time on task, it was surprising that in a previous study, we accidentally found a decline of temporal order judgment (TOJ) performance within 5-8 min. After replicating prior relevant findings we tested whether pauses and/or feedback relating the participant's performance to some ""standard"" can eliminate or reduce this short-term performance decline. We also assessed whether the performance decline is specific to the processes evoked by the TOJ task or it is a product of either general inattentiveness or the lack of willingness to thoroughly follow the task instructions. We found that both feedback and introducing pauses between successive measurements can largely reduce the performance decline, and that these two manipulations likely mobilize overlapping capacities. Performance decline was not present in a similar task when controlling for the TOJ threshold and it was not a result of uncooperative behavior. Therefore, we conclude that the TOJ threshold decline is either specific to temporal processing in general or to the TOJ task employed in the study. Overall, the results are compatible with the notion that the decline of TOJ threshold with repeated measures represents a short-term cognitive fatigue effect. This objective fatigue measure did not correlate with subjective fatigue. The latter was rather related to perceived difficulty/effort, the reduction of positive affectivity, heightened sensitivity to criticism, and the best TOJ threshold.",,"[Simon, Julia; Takacs, Endre; Winkler, Istvan] Res Ctr Nat Sci, Inst Cognit Neurosci & Psychol, Magyar Tudosok Korutja 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Simon, Julia; Berki, Borbala] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Cognit Sci, Fac Nat Sci, Budapest, Hungary; [Simon, Julia] Pazmany Peter Catholic Univ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Budapest, Hungary; [Takacs, Endre] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Inst Psychol, Budapest, Hungary; [Takacs, Endre] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Doctoral Sch Psychol, Budapest, Hungary; [Orosz, Gabor] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA USA; [Berki, Borbala] Szechenyi Istvan Univ, Multidisciplinary Doctoral Sch Engn Sci, Gyor, Hungary; [Simon, Julia] Res Ctr Nat Sci, Inst Cognit Neurosci & Psychol, Magyar Tudosok Korutja 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Simon, Julia] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Cognit Sci, Fac Nat Sci, Budapest, Hungary; [Simon, Julia] Pazmany Peter Catholic Univ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Budapest, Hungary",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,Neurosciences,WOS:000511788500005,

The aim of the current study was to examine whether regulation of disappointment impairs cognitive performance in kindergarten children (mean age = 5 years, 6 months). Disappointment was induced by means of a modified version of the disappointing gift paradigm. Ego depletion effects were examined based on two different variables: cognitive performance and behavioral responses. Participants assigned to the experimental condition (n = 74) were disappointed before solving a cognitive executive function task. Participants assigned to the control condition (n = 74) were not disappointed before solving the cognitive task. Group comparisons (i.e., control group vs. experimental group) showed reduced cognitive performance for the experimental group in terms of accuracy and in terms of speed. Subsequent analyses for the experimental group revealed that only children who expressed appreciative positive emotions when receiving the unwanted gift showed impaired performance on the subsequent cognitive task. Children who expressed negative emotions when receiving the unwanted gift, as well as children who displayed no reaction toward the unwanted gift, did not show impaired cognitive performance. Furthermore, results revealed the crucial role of language for self-regulation skills.

The limitations of the possibility of exact replications are shown on the example of these attempts. The replications, the results of which fail to reproduce the results of the initial study are not to be viewed without reservations as the proofs of invalidation of the initial study, even if they are performed methodologically faultlessly.

The research described includes sport-specific research but also studies that focus on general motivational principles that look beyond sport-specific phenomena. We propose that attentional - rather than limited resource - explanations of self-control have more value for athletic performance. Moreover, we integrate self-control ideas with descriptions of motivational phenomena to derive novel hypotheses concerning how self-control can be optimized during sport performance. We explain how minimizing desire-goal conflicts by fusing self-control processes and performance goals can delay aversive consequences of self-control that may impede performance. We also suggest that autonomous performance goals are an important motivational input that enhances the effectiveness of self-control processes by (1) reducing the salience of the desire to reduce performance-related discomfort, (2) increasing attentional resources towards optimal performance, and (3) optimizing monitoring and modification of self-control processes.

It typically contains two dimensions: Agency and communion. Agency denotes motives to advance the well-being of self within a social hierarchy, as manifested in achievement, social power, or material wealth. Communion denotes motives to advance the well-being of others, as manifested in concerns for disadvantaged, distant others, or the ecological wellbeing of the planet. Based on Sina Weibo data, the current study has depicted how moral motivation fluctuated throughout the day. Our Weibo data contained tens of millions of social media user statistics and hundreds of microblogs. Two separate levels of analysis were used to explore the changes of moral motivation. The first level was group-means level. In this level, we used all data we collected including all microblog users, and the ""group-means"" means the word frequencies of communion or agency per minute, which neglected the individual differences. The second level was individual-means level. In this level, only the most active individuals were included. When we calculated the moral motivation per minute, we first looked at the communion/agency of each user, and then averaged the results of all users. Results indicated that moral motivation in the morning was higher than that in the afternoon, evening, and night, with rejuvenating benefits of eating and sleeping at both group level and individual level. Moreover, there appeared a diverging effect between agency and communion. Specifically, we have found that after eating (especially lunch) and sleeping (including naps around noon), moral motivation peaked and then decreased until the next time for food and bed, which is consistent with the traditional Chinese belief that every morning is a refreshing start in everyday life. Our findings also extend previous research on self-regulatory strength depletion and restoration to the domain of moral motivation, and changes of moral motivation might be the real cause and underlying mechanism behind the behavioral differences in the morning and the afternoon. The current study makes contributions in several areas. First, this research has provided a complete picture of moral changes throughout the day for the very first time based on Sina Weibo data. Second, this research advances the literature on moral behaviors by including changes of moral motivation, which might be a crucial and new mediator for moral behavioral changes. Third, our findings increase the generalizability of previous research on moral behaviors by replicating the findings with a Chinese sample. Finally, compared with survey study and experiments, the social media data we collected and utilized include more comprehensive and in-depth information, which contributes to the robustness of our results. Taken together, our findings provide further validation and empirical support for the morning morality effect and reveal the dynamic pattern of the changes of human moral motivation.",,"[Yu, Feng] Wuhan Univ, Dept Psychol, Sch Philosophy, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Xu, Liying; Peng, Kaiping; Hu, Xiaomeng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Social Sci, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Han, Tingting] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Inst Social Psychol, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhiyuan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Qian, Xiaojun] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiaomeng] Renmin Univ, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiaomeng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Social Sci, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiaomeng] Renmin Univ, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,WOS:000560211200016,

However, these measures face critical limitations in populations that are inherently difficult to study. Members of difficult-to-study populations (e.g., patients, children, non-human animals) are less accessible to researchers, which typically results in small-sample studies that are infeasible to replicate. Nevertheless, meta-analyses on clinical neuropsychological data suggest that difficult-to-study populations can be studied in a reliable way. These analyses often produce unbiased effect-size estimates despite aggregating across severely underpowered original studies. This finding can be attributed to a neuropsychological research culture involving the non-selective reporting of results from standardized and validated test procedures. Consensus guidelines, test manuals, and psychometric evidence constrain the methodological choices made by neuropsychologists, who regularly report the results from neuropsychological test batteries irrespective of their statistical significance or novelty. Comparable shifts toward more standardization and validation, complete result reports, and between-lab collaborations can allow for a meaningful and reliable study of psychological phenomena in other difficult-to-study populations.",,"[Lange, Florian] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Behav Engn Res Grp, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Lange, Florian] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Behav Engn Res Grp, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000517756900004,

Two parallel, but overlapping, bodies of literature (i.e., ego depletion, mental fatigue) have examined this question. However, research to date has not merged these separate lines of inquiry to assess the overall magnitude of this effect. Objective The present work reports the results of a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis examining carryover effects of cognitive exertion on physical performance. Methods A systematic search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus was conducted. Only randomized controlled trials involving healthy humans, a central executive task requiring cognitive exertion, an easier cognitive comparison task, and a physical performance task were included. Results A total of 73 studies provided 91 comparisons with 2581 participants. Random effects meta-analysis showed a significant small-to-medium negative effect of prior cognitive exertion on physical performance (g = - 0.38 [95% CI - 0.46, - 0.31]). Subgroup analyses showed that cognitive tasks lasting < 30-min (g = - 0.45) and >= 30-min (g = - 0.30) have similar significant negative effects on subsequent physical performance. Prior cognitive exertion significantly impairs isometric resistance (g = - 0.57), motor (g = - 0.57), dynamic resistance (g = - 0.51), and aerobic performance (g = - 0.26), but the effects on maximal anaerobic performance are trivial and non-significant (g = 0.10). Studies employing between-subject designs showed a medium negative effect (g = - 0.65), whereas within-subject designs had a small negative effect (g = - 0.28). Conclusion Findings demonstrate that cognitive exertion has a negative effect on subsequent physical performance that is not due to chance and suggest that previous meta-analysis results may have underestimated the overall effect.",,"[Brown, Denver M.

However, there is a concern that publication bias and selective reporting may lead to biased meta-analytic effect sizes. We compare the results of meta-analyses to large-scale preregistered replications in psychology carried out at multiple laboratories. The multiple-laboratory replications provide precisely estimated effect sizes that do not suffer from publication bias or selective reporting. We searched the literature and identified 15 meta-analyses on the same topics as multiple-laboratory replications. We find that meta-analytic effect sizes are significantly different from replication effect sizes for 12 out of the 15 meta-replication pairs.

In this study, we conducted two experiments to examine the effect of effort on reward valuation (Experiment 1) and whether this effect can be influenced by cooperation (Experiment 2), using electroencephalogram (EEG) technology. We found that when participants worked alone, they generated a larger feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitude for losing rewards than for gaining rewards, with more effort resulting in larger FRN amplitudes for losing rewards. However, when participants worked together with a partner, there was no significant difference between the amplitude for gaining rewards and that for losing rewards during low-effort tasks. Nevertheless, for high-effort tasks, the FRN amplitude for losing rewards was significantly larger than that for gaining rewards. Moreover, in both experiments, we found larger N1 amplitudes for gaining rewards than for losing rewards.

This provided the incentive and opportunity for the athletes to cheat. Following this, athletes completed two questionnaires, which assessed the Dark Triad and their attitudes towards doping. All three Dark Triad personality traits correlated positively with attitudes towards doping and cheating behaviour. Regression analyses revealed that psychopathy and narcissism positively predicted attitudes towards doping, and narcissism emerged as a positive predictor of cheating behaviour. Attitudes towards doping correlated positively with cheating behaviour. The Dark Triad appears to be important in relation to both attitudes towards doping and cheating behaviour among athletes.

We predicted and found that prior self-control increased students' motivation for active pursuit of the academic goal. In Study 1, prior self-control reduced students' behavioral intentions for school work and non-academic activities alike when academic pursuit was not activated. Under active pursuit of the academic goal, however, prior self-control uniquely increased students' intentions for school work. In Study 2, this facilitatory effect of prior self-control on behavioral intention toward an academic goal was replicated and accompanied by positive implicit attitudes toward study-related stimuli. In Study 3, when preparing to pursue the academic goal, prior self-control increased students' tendency to proactively remove a temptation from the immediate context (leave their phone with the experimenter) to support better task performance.

Scientists should therefore strive to improve the precision of their methods, especially in fields with noisy measurements. Here, we show that automation can reduce measurement error by similar to 60% in one domain of developmental psychology: controlled-rearing studies of newborn chicks. Automated studies produce measurements that are 3-4 times more precise than non-automated studies and produce effect sizes that are 3-4 times larger than non-automated studies.

However. certain populations may be more susceptible to these effects of depleted self-control capacity. For example, individuals with lower alcohol sensitivity (i.e., requiring more drinks to experience the effects of alcohol) are a high-risk group who are likely to engage in hazardous alcohol use and develop an alcohol use disorder. Those lower in alcohol sensitivity also exhibit heightened motivational reactivity in response to alcohol-related cues, which may be enhanced following exertion of self-control. However, whether drinkers lower in alcohol sensitivity are at higher risk for exhibiting greater motivations toward alcohol-related cues after exerting self-control is unclear. The current research examined the role of alcohol sensitivity in predicting approach motivation following exertion of self-control. It was expected drinkers exerting self-control would exhibit greater orientation toward rewarding cues, particularly after viewing alcohol-related cues. However, we predicted this pattern would be most prominent among drinkers lower in alcohol sensitivity. Experiment 1 supported these hypotheses, with lower alcohol sensitivity predicting greater approach motivation among drinkers required to exert self-control prior to viewing alcohol-related compared to neutral cues. Experiment 2 aimed to replicate these findings by assessing asymmetrical frontal cortical activation, an index of approach motivation. Drinkers with lower alcohol sensitivity exhibited greater relative left frontal cortical activation, consistent with approach motivation, while viewing alcohol-related cues following exertion of self-control.

Our working hypothesis is that the form of fatigue resulting from physical training overload might share some neural underpinnings with the form of fatigue observed after prolonged intellectual work, which was previously shown to affect the cognitive control brain system. Indeed, cognitive control may be required to prevent any impulsive behavior, including stopping physical effort when it hurts, despite the long-term goal of improving performance through intense training. To test this hypothesis, we induced a mild form of overtraining in a group of endurance athletes, which we compared to a group of normally trained athletes on behavioral tasks performed during fMRI scanning. At the behavioral level, training overload enhanced impulsivity in economic choice, which was captured by a bias favoring immediate over delayed rewards in our computational model. At the neural level, training overload resulted in diminished activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex, a key region of the cognitive control system, during economic choice. Our results therefore provide causal evidence for a functional link between enduring physical exercise and exerting cognitive control. Besides, the concept of cognitive control fatigue bridges the functional consequences of excessive physical training and intellectual work into a single neuro-computational mechanism, which might contribute to other clinical forms of burnout syndromes.",,"[Blain, Bastien; Pessiglione, Mathias] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Motivat Brain & Behav Team, Ctr NeuroImagerie Rech, Inst Cerveau & Moelle Epiniere, F-75013 Paris, France; [Blain, Bastien; Pessiglione, Mathias] Sorbonne Univ, INSERM UMRS 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, F-75005 Paris, France; [Blain, Bastien] Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75013 Paris, France; [Blain, Bastien] UCL, Max Planck UCL Ctr Computat Psychiat & Ageing Res, London WC1B 5EH, England; [Schmit, Cyril; Aubry, Anael; Le Meur, Yann] French Inst Sport Expertise & Performance INSEP, Res Dept, Lab Sport Expertise & Performance INSEP, F-75012 Paris, France; [Schmit, Cyril; Hausswirth, Christophe; Le Meur, Yann] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Lab LAMHESS EA6312, F-06108 Nice, France; [Blain, Bastien; Pessiglione, Mathias] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Motivat Brain & Behav Team, Ctr NeuroImagerie Rech, Inst Cerveau & Moelle Epiniere, F-75013 Paris, France; [Blain, Bastien; Pessiglione, Mathias] Sorbonne Univ, INSERM UMRS 1127, CNRS UMR 7225, F-75005 Paris, France",,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biology; Cell Biology,WOS:000489095500041,

The glucose hypothesis of self-control posits that acts of self-control may draw upon glucose as a source of energy, leading to a decrease in blood glucose levels after exerting self-control, mirroring the temporary depletion of self-control, but supporting evidence is mixed and inconclusive. This might partly be due to using methods that are not suitable to reliably quantify glucose utilization. Aims. We aimed at examining whether self-control exertion leads to an increase in glucose utilization. Method. In a sample of N = 30 healthy participants (50% women, age 26.5 +/- 3.5 years) we combined a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp (a well-established and validated procedure in experimental endocrinology to reliably quantify systemic glucose utilization) with a standard self-control dual-task paradigm. In the first task, the experimental group completed a variation of a paper-and-pencil crossing out letter task (COLT) that demanded self-control; the control group completed a variation of the COLT that did not demand self-control. The second task for both groups was a computerized two-color word Stroop which demanded self-control. Results.

In this paper, we present a motivational approach to exhaustion and recovery that takes into account the multidimensional nature of the constructs. The account details three psychological processes that may - individually and in interaction - underlie exhaustion and recovery. Specifically, we propose that changes in mood, subjective time perception, and opportunity costs experienced during an ongoing effortful or relaxing activity indicate a person's momentary degree of exhaustion and recovery and impact the decision of whether the person should continue or disengage from the activity at hand. Addressing developmental changes across adulthood, we present two opposing hypotheses on how younger and older adults may differ in their experiences of exhaustion and recovery: (i) Older adults may experience an accelerated subjective time perception compared to younger adults and may thus feel less exhausted (more recovered) than younger adults after spending an identical amount of time engaged in an effortful (relaxing) activity. (ii) Older adults may be more sensitive toward increasing opportunity costs experienced during an effortful or relaxing activity and may therefore feel exhausted or recovered faster than younger adults.",,"[Cardini, Brian B.] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychol, Binzmuehlestr 14-11, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Zurich, Univ Res Prior Program Dynam Hlth Aging, Zurich, Switzerland; [Cardini, Brian B.] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychol, Binzmuehlestr 14-11, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland",,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000496770400003,

We suggest that although managers might potentially benefit more from employees' upward voice when they are more depleted, they are paradoxically less likely to diligently process or endorse such voice under ego depletion. We draw from ego depletion theory and argue that when managers are more depleted of their self-control resources, they will spend less cognitive effort in processing voice. In turn, they tend to reject employee voice due to status quo bias and confirmation bias. We further suggest that the detrimental effect of ego depletion on voice endorsement is stronger when the voicing employee is perceived as having low expertise. We conducted an experience sampling study surveying 62 managers about voice events they encounter at work over 10 days (Study 1) and an experiment with 198 managers (Study 2).

In a typical workweek, 195 part-time teleworkers filled out daily surveys (729 days), and we examined the relationship between working location (office and home) and self-leading behavior as well as the mediating role of autonomy. Finally, we investigated whether self-leading behavior relates to ego depletion and work satisfaction at the end of the working day.

In four studies, we validated a new version - the 5-item scale for measuring the momentary self-control capacity (SMS-5; English version available in Table 1) - of Ciarocco's State Self-Control Capacity Scale (SSCCS) to assess changes in people's perceived state self-control capacity (i.e., degree of perceived mental exhaustion) in achievement situations. Drawing on German samples of apprentices in vocational education and training (N = 2,395), tenth-graders (N = 129), and university students (N = 95; N = 140), we replicated the unidimensional internal structure of the SMS-5.

The psychology behind exploiting others and protecting against exploitation is still poorly understood and is addressed here in an incentivized economic contest game in which individuals invested in predatory attack and prey defense. Consistent with standard economic theory on production and predation, we find that individuals compete less intensely when they attack rather than defend and that attacks disproportionally often fail. We find, furthermore. 2 psychological mechanisms that restrain attack more than defense. First, individuals with stronger concern for others' welfare (Experiment 1a) and with stronger empathy (Experiment 1b) less frequently attack and when they attack, they do so less forcefully. Second. shorter decision times (Experiment 2a and Experiment 2b), along with cognitive taxation (Experiment 2b) associate with more forceful, but not with more frequent attack. Finally, investments in defense were neither predicted by other-concern and empathy, nor by decision time and cognitive taxation. Thus, individuals with stronger prosocial preferences and more deliberated decisions spent less energy on injuring others, and less often defeated their antagonists but ended-up personally wealthier.

Using TMS, we here disrupted an area known to be involved in self-control processes, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), to provide causal evidence as to whether diminished self-control leads to less intergenerational sustainability. Participants then engaged in a behavioural economic paradigm to measure sustainable decision-making towards the next generation. This adequately powered study could not find an effect of inhibiting the right dlPFC on intergenerational sustainability. This result holds when controlling for a number of relevant covariates like gender, trait self-control, pro-environmental attitudes, or cortical thickness at the stimulation site.

We translated the complex-span tasks and had a sample of German participants perform these tasks as well as a running-memory-span task and a reasoning test. We assessed the reliabilities of the German complex-span tasks and their construct and criterion-related validities. Extrapolating from cross-cultural literature, we also employed a test of measurement invariance to compare the correlational patterns as well as the construct structure between the German sample and a similar North-American sample. Results show that the German complex-span tasks are reliable and valid indicators of working-memory capacity and that they are metrically and functionally equivalent to the original versions.

For example, the kind of minimal p-hacking that increases the false-positive rate of 1 study to just 8% increases the false-positive rate of a 10-study internal meta-analysis to 83%. If selective reporting is approximately zero, but not exactly zero, then internal meta-analysis is invalid.

Furthermore, this relationship may be mediated by a negative reaction to this pressure, in the form of impulsivity (or negative urgency). To date, no research has investigated whether the relationship between SPP and DE is mediated by negative urgency, nor has there been research clarifying how in-group identification relates to DE, independent of SPP and negative urgency. To address these gaps, we assessed these variables in 147 female dieters (M-age = 25.12 years, SD = 3.08) using a cross-sectional design. Consistent with our hypotheses, negative urgency fully mediated the link between female-based SPP and disordered eating, while female-based in-group affect (identification) was predictive of disordered eating (although the latter relationship was not sustained in a multiple regression model). These findings suggest that the SPP from other women may relate to DE through increasing negative urgency, and that the link between in-group (female) affect and DE may be better explained by SPP's link to DE.",,"[Bouguettaya, Ayoub; Moulding, Richard; King, Ross M.; Harrold, Georgia] Deakin Univ, Fac Hlth, 1 Gheringhap St, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Bouguettaya, Ayoub] Deakin Univ, Fac Hlth, 1 Gheringhap St, Geelong, Vic, Australia",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000474274600010,

In our study, we investigated the effects of a short mindfulness exercise on physical performance in a state with temporarily depleted self-control strength (ego depletion). We applied a mixed between- (ego depletion: yes vs. no) and within- (two times of measurement, 7 days apart; mindfulness: yes vs. no; order counterbalanced) subjects design to test our hypothesis in a sample of 34 sport students.

A crucial question for public administration is how bureaucracies can be organized in ways that minimize illegitimate discrimination. Especially, since theories suggest that prejudices happen unintentionally and particularly under high workload, bureaucrats' working conditions may be important. Four randomized experiments support the notion that bureaucrats discriminate as a way of coping with high workload. Most notably, a field experiment randomly assigned teachers to reduced workloads by giving them resources to have more time with the same group of students. In a subsequent survey experiment-using a fictitious future scenario unrelated to the resources provided in the field experiment-discrimination was minimized in the field treatment group, but persisted in the control group. The results thereby support the notion that even though discrimination among bureaucrats does not (only) occur in a reflective manner it can be reduced by altering the way bureaucrats' work is organized.",,"[Andersen, Simon Calmar; Guul, Thorbjom Sejr] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Andersen, Simon Calmar] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark",,,,,,,,11,,,,,,,Political Science; Public Administration,WOS:000493048900004,

By using within-person designs in a laboratory (Study 1; 187 participants) and an ambulatory assessment study (Study 2; 125 participants), we sought to clarify this ambiguity by investigating whether prominent situational variables (such as motivation and affect) or personality traits can help elucidate when ego depletion can be observed and when not. Although only marginal ego-depletion effects were found in both studies, these effects varied considerably between individuals, indicating that some individuals experience self-control decrements after initial self-control exertion and others not. However, neither motivation nor affect nor personality traits such as trait self-control could consistently explain this variability when models were applied that controlled for variance due to targets and the depletion manipulation (Study 1) or days (Study 2) as well as for multiple testing.

However, inhibitory control is a multi-component process that also comprises signal detection and proactive control. It is unknown whether intoxication and cue exposure selectively influence these subprocesses in heavy drinkers.ObjectivesIn two pre-registered studies, we investigated whether exposure to alcohol-related cues (study 1) and alcohol priming (study 2) impair each of these subprocesses of inhibitory control and increase motivation to drink.MethodsIn study 1, 64 heavy drinkers completed a modified stop-signal task in an alcohol context (with embedded alcohol cues) and a neutral context (with embedded neutral cues) followed by a subjective measure of craving and a bogus taste test to measure ad libitum alcohol consumption. In study 2, 36 heavy drinkers consumed an alcoholic beverage (0.6g/kg body weight), an alcohol-placebo beverage, and water on a within-subjects basis, followed by the modified stop-signal task and a bogus taste test.ResultsIn study 1, alcohol cue exposure did not impair inhibitory control subprocesses. Reactive control was unexpectedly better following alcohol cue exposure (compared to neutral cue exposure). However, craving and ad libitum consumption increased as expected. In study 2, reactive control was significantly impaired following the alcohol and control primes, relative to the placebo, but there was no effect on proactive slowing or signal detection.

Methods: At baseline, trait self-control strength as well as the intention to take part in the respective sports course on a regular basis were measured. Then, we registered weekly participation and asked the participants after each training session to report their intention to show up at next week's training session. Results: Despite very high baseline as well as weekly exercise intentions, the participation rate dropped considerably over time, indicating a large intention-behavior gap. The association of within-person fluctuations in weekly intentions and actual participation was moderated by self-control: Only in individuals with high levels of trait self-control strength stronger intentions were associated with a higher chance of actual re-attendance.

Fatigue could be due to (1) depletion of a finite resource of physical and/or psychological energy or (2) changes in motivation, attention, and goal-directed effort (e.g. motivational control theory). Purpose To contrast predictions from these two views in a real-time study of subjective fatigue in nurses while working. Methods One hundred nurses provided 1,453 assessments over two 12-hr shifts. Nurses rated fatigue, demand, control, and reward every 90 min. Physical energy expenditure was measured objectively using Actiheart. Hypotheses were tested using multilevel models to predict fatigue from (a) the accumulated values of physical energy expended, demand, control, and reward over the shift and (b) from distributed lag models of the same variables over the previous 90 min. Results Virtually all participants showed increasing fatigue over the work period. This increase was slightly greater when working overnight. Fatigue was not dependent on physical energy expended nor perceived work demands. However, it was related to perceived control over work and perceived reward associated with work. Conclusions Findings provide little support for a resource depletion model; however, the finding that control and reward both predicted fatigue is consistent with a motivational account of fatigue. In an intensive real time study, fatigue in working nurses was predicted by self-rated control and reward but not work demand nor objectively measured energy expended.",,"[Johnston, Derek W.; Allan, Julia L.; Powell, Daniel J.

Reward-relevant after-effects are relatively underappreciated in self-control research. In the current paper, we review theory and research pertaining to the idea that exercising self-control increases reward responsivity.

However, it remains unclear whether ego depletion makes participants unable to exert self-control or unwilling to exert self-control when it increases dishonesty. The present study aimed to clarify this. Based on the process model, ego depletion causes individuals to pay more attention to material rewards and increases the motivation to act on impulse. Therefore, it is possible that ego-depleted participants are unwilling, rather than unable, to be honest. We conducted two experiments to examine this hypothesis. Results showed that ego depletion increased material-based dishonesty even when the dishonest behavior was more complicated and effortful than was the honest behavior. However, participants were reluctant to cheat just for convenience, and ego depletion had no apparent effect on convenience-based dishonesty without any material rewards.

Method: In an observational, repeated-measures study, data from approximately 4,000 calls to 150 nurses working for the Scottish NHS 24 medical helpline (37% of the national workforce) were modeled to determine whether the likelihood of a nurse's decision to refer a patient to another health professional the same day (the clinically safest but most conservative and resource inefficient decision) varied according to the number of calls taken/time elapsed since a nurse's last rest break and/or since the start of shift. Analyses used mixed-effect logistic regression. Results: For every consecutive call taken since last rest break, the odds of nurses making a conservative management decision (i.e., arranging for callers to see another health professional the same day) increased by 5.5% (p=.001, 95% confidence interval [CI:2.2, 8.8]), an increase in odds of 20.5% per work hour (p<.001, 95% CI [9.1, 33.2]) or 49.0% (on average) from immediately after 1 break to immediately before the next. Decision-making was not significantly related to general or cumulative workload (calls or time elapsed since start of shift). Conclusions: Every consecutive decision that nurses make since their last break produces a predictable shift toward more conservative, and less resource-efficient, decisions.

The EIT task retains elements of existing behavioral tasks (e.g., indices of persistence) while augmenting the reliability and content sufficiency of existing measures by including multiple trials, including a variety of negative affect stimuli, and separating overall task persistence from task persistence after onset of distress. In a series of three studies, we found that the EIT correlated with extant behavioral measures of distress tolerance, the computerized mirror-tracing task and a physical cold pressor task.

There is evidence, that learning with elaborative interrogation is beneficial. However, it is conceivable that for elaborative interrogation to be beneficial for learning, learners also need resources available to be able to correctly generate parts of the study material. In this connection, one potentially important factor for successfully carrying out such effortful analytic processes, like generating information, is cognitive self-control. However, self-control seems to be a limited resource that can be depleted. Hence, under conditions of depleted self-regulatory resources (ego depletion), elaborative interrogation might lead to an incomplete generation of the requested information, resulting in incomplete study material. Thus, elaborative interrogation may be only beneficial under nondepleted conditions, but disadvantageous under depleted conditions. To investigate this, 97 persons were randomly assigned to one of four conditions resulting from a 2 x 2 between-subjects design with the independent variables ego depletion (yes vs. no) and learning condition (elaborative interrogation vs. control). Ego depletion was manipulated with a writing task: Participants were instructed to transcribe a text on a blank sheet, but only participants in the depletion condition were instructed to omit the letters e and n wherever they would normally appear in their writing. For the elaborative interrogation condition, some segments of the regular text were removed and prompts asking for that particular information were provided. For the control condition, the regular text was provided while no prompts were given. The main dependent variables were the learning outcome measures of a retention test and a transfer test. 2 x 2-ANCOVAs showed no effects of ego depletion, no effects of learning condition and no interaction between ego depletion and learning condition - neither for retention nor for transfer. The concept of ego depletion is recently discussed controversy and these results do contribute to the skeptical view that queries the impact of the concept of ego depletion - at least for cognitive tasks. Moreover, these results question whether elaborative interrogation are also desirable when assessing learning outcomes by means of retention and transfer tests.",,"[Kuehl, Tim] Univ Mannheim, Psychol Educ, Mannheim, Germany; [Bertrams, Alex] Univ Bern, Educ Psychol, Bern, Switzerland; [Kuehl, Tim] Univ Mannheim, Psychol Educ, Mannheim, Germany",,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000462834400001,

The anonymous economic dictator game is an effective index of prosocial behaviors. We examined the influence of exerting self-control on prosocial behavior and the moderating role of awe on the effect of exerting self-control on prosocial behaviors in two experiments (N = 280). We adopted the incongruent Stroop task to induce the exertion of self-control and participants were required to allocate money to others in the anonymous dictator game (Experiment 1). We used the narrative recall task paradigm to elicit the emotion of awe during the interval between Stroop tasks and the dictator game (Experiment 2).

If evidence for this ""ego-depletion"" effect was initially believed to be strong, it is now questioned. Recent meta-analyses indicated that this effect was sensitive to publication bias and that it was greatly reduced after control for this bias. In a pre-registered replication attempt where an ego-depletion protocol was conducted in multiple independent laboratories, the effect was not distinguishable from zero. Here, a different approach is adopted to examine the validity of this effect by improving the experimental protocol with the addition of important methodological precautions: 1) a pre-test measurement, 2) a learning period, 3) a prolonged depleting task, 4) a similar control condition, and 5) valid indexes of self-control. Accordingly, a well-learned Simon task was done before and after 1 h of continuous practice of a Stroop task in a high inhibition demands condition (75% of incongruent trials) or in a control condition (0% of incongruent trials). Datasets from between-subjects (Study 1, N=82) and within-subjects (Study 2, N=52) experiments were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. A significant ego-depletion effect was found in Study 1 (greater interference effect and accuracy decline in high inhibition demands than in control condition) but not in Study 2.

We are harnessing these findings in order to accurately analyze and better understand the neural basis of self-controlled sprint start performance. Design: In a within-subject experimental design, participants executed three different sprint start sequences (Ready-Set-Go) for ten times each. In the no-start condition, participants only had to avoid producing a false start (impulse control) and in the experimental conditions-either with fixed or with supposedly variable set-start intervals-they additionally had to execute a fast start (impulse control + action initiation). Methods: We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to assess cerebral oxygenation in the lPFC during sprint start in 33 male participants. Results: Results show that cerebral oxygenation increased after the set-signal and this increase was particularly pronounced in the fixed and supposedly-variable start conditions. Post-hoc analyses further indicated that oxygenation differences between no-start and the two start conditions were particularly pronounced in anterior parts of the LPFC. Discussion: This is the first study to reveal oxygenation changes in self-control relevant cortical areas during sprint start performance.

Although some apparent failures of self-control are, on closer inspection, reward maximizing, at least some self-control failures are clearly disadvantageous and non-strategic. The existence of poor self-control presents an important evolutionary puzzle because there is no obvious reason why good self-control should be more costly than poor self-control. After all, a rock is infinitely patient. I propose that self-control failures result from cases in which well-learned (and thus routinized) decision-making strategies yield suboptimal choices. These mappings persist in the decision-makers' repertoire because they result from learning processes that are adaptive in the broader context, either on the timescale of learning or of evolution. Self-control, then, is a form of cognitive control and the subjective feeling of effort likely reflects the true costs of cognitive control.

We then examine the theoretical consequences that ensue from this assumption. This framework naturally explains why some tasks - for example, unfamiliar or dual tasks - are costly and permits to quantify these costs using information-theoretic measures. Finally, we discuss brain implementation of this principle and show that subjective cognitive costs can originate either from local or global capacity limitations on information processing or from increased rate of metabolic alterations.

Experimental condition was expected to moderate the relationship between implicit measures of alcohol-related associations and drinking, with a more positive relationship between alcohol-related associations and drinking among participants who completed the more (vs. less) cognitive demanding task. Secondary aims were to evaluate how individual differences in control factors (implicit theories about willpower and working memory capacity) might further moderate those relationships.

A sample of 44 male college students underwent baseline cognitive assessment (EF and lower-order cognitive processes), followed by experimental manipulation consisting of exposure to sexually explicit audiovisual stimuli. Sexual arousal was monitored using penile plethysmography. In this study, 21 participants were assigned to a suppression condition and were instructed to suppress sexual arousal during the video, while 23 were assigned to an arousal condition and were instructed to allow themselves to become aroused. Following experimental manipulation, cognition was reassessed. Unexpectedly, results showed EF decrements in the arousal group but not in the suppression group. As expected, only EF was affected by experimental manipulation, with no group differences in lower-order cognitive processes.

Poverty has been premised as one of the main causes of various forms of non-productive behaviour such as the unwillingness to delay gratification. The paper aims to examine the relationship between income, as an objective economic indicator, and poor delay of gratification. It puts a particular focus on different poverty thresholds and also after taking cognitive load into account. Sample and settings. A total of 697 participants (out of which 233 also completed the retest) were recruited in two data collections. The participants provided information about their household income, frequency in experiencing negative affect and stress (together forming cognitive load) as well as their tendency to delay gratification. Statistical analysis. The effect sizes for each subsample and poverty threshold were synthesized in a multilevel meta-analysis. Additional Bayesian estimations served as a sensitivity analysis. In order to test whether the average effect sizes differed from hedges' g = 0.2 (our smallest effect size of interest), equivalence testing was used. Results. The results indicated very small effects of poverty thresholds on the willingness to delay gratification. Hedges' g varied from -0.01 to 0.20 for all the performed analyses. Study limitations.

A nonreplication could indicate that a previous finding might have been a false positive statistical result and the effect does not exist. However, it could also mean that a specific detail of the experimental procedure is essential for the effect to emerge, which might not have been included in the replication attempt. Therefore any replication attempt that does not replicate the original effect is most informative when the original procedure is closely adhered to. One proposed solution to facilitate the empirical reproducibility of the experimental procedures in psychology is to upload the experimental script and materials to a public repository. However, we believe that merely providing the materials of an experimental procedure is not sufficient, as many software solutions are not freely available, software solutions might change, and it is time consuming to set up the procedure. We argue that there is a simple solution to these problems when an experiment is conducted using computers: recording an example procedure with a screen capture software and providing the video in an online repository. We therefore provide a brief tutorial on screen recordings using an open source screen recording software. With this information, individual researchers should be able to record their experimental procedures and we hope to facilitate the use of screen recordings in computer assisted data collection procedures.",,"[Heycke, Tobias] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Mannheim, Germany; [Spitzer, Lisa] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Heycke, Tobias] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Mannheim, Germany",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000500711000012,

The aim of our experiment was to examine whether this effect, called ego depletion, is influenced by application of certain strategies that help people to overcome impulses. Another purpose of our research was to investigate the role of self-control as a trait in this area. We focused on amusement regulation because of its importance in everyday life. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE Participants (N = 90) completed the Self-Control Scale (NAS-50) and were then asked to rate humorous cartoons (Task 1) while inducing the following self-regulatory strategies suggested by the instructions: cognitive change, response inhibition, or none (between-subjects manipulation). Subsequently, participants performed the Stop Signal Task (Task 2). RESULTS The results indicate that the depletion effect is absent unless trait self-control is included in the analysis. We ob-served the interaction between the self-control trait and the effectiveness of the adopted self-regulatory strategy. Participants with poor self-control did not differ in their performance in Task 2, regardless of the adopted strategy. With the increase in the self-control trait, we observed differences in Task 2 that indicated that the cognitive change strategy guarded against depletion in participants with a medium level of self-control. Participants with a high self-control trait level obtained better scores in both regulatory groups, compared to the condition without any strategy.

Current large-scale replication projects represent an important step forward for assessing replicability, but provide only limited information because they have thus far been designed in a manner such that heterogeneity either cannot be assessed or is intended to be eliminated. Consequently, the nontrivial degree of heterogeneity found in these projects represents a lower bound on the true degree of heterogeneity. We recommend enriching large-scale replication projects going forward by embracing heterogeneity. We argue this is the key for assessing replicability: if effect sizes are sufficiently heterogeneous-even if the sign of the effect is consistent-the phenomenon in question does not seem particularly replicable and the theory underlying it seems poorly constructed and in need of enrichment. Uncovering why and revising theory in light of it will lead to improved theory that explains heterogeneity and increases replicability.

A total of 321 winter sport youth athletes (173 males, 98 females, and 50 unknown gender; aged 16 to 20 years, M = 17.98, SD = 0.89) participated in this 10-week longitudinal study, including three time points. Using Bayesian structural equation modeling, associations between athletes' reported level of motivation regulations, self-control, and exhaustion throughout their competitive season were examined in two mediation models. Constructs were associated in a conceptual and consistent manner. Simple mediation models showed credible indirect and direct effects of motivation on exhaustion via self-control within amotivation, and intrinsic, integrated, identified, and external regulation analyses. These credible effects were not replicated in the focused mediation model, when controlling for self-control and exhaustion autoregressive effects. However, direction of effects in both models was consistent and congruent. Findings consistently supported the interplay between motivation and exhaustion via self-control in youth athletes over an important competition period of the year. Autonomous and controlled motivation interacted with self-control and, respectively, predicted perceived exhaustion negatively and positively. Thus, autonomous self-control motives are important in preventing negative sport participation development over time. However, simple and focused mediation models showed different results, suggesting a necessity for accurate considerations of analytical methods chosen to investigate longitudinal mediation.

Second, the median proportion of the observed variation among reported effect sizes attributed to heterogeneity is 74% (I-2). Heterogeneity of this magnitude makes it unlikely that the typical psychological study can be closely replicated when replication is defined as study-level null hypothesis significance testing.

Previous research has shown a strong correlation between these contrasts, where default samples and distant perspectives are the norm. Distancing is sometimes seen as necessary for objectivity, and an engaged orientation is sometimes criticized as biased, advocacy research, especially if the researcher shares a social group membership with the study population (e.g., a black male researcher studying black male students). The lack of diversity in study samples has been paralleled by a lack of diversity in the researchers themselves. The salience of default samples and distancing in prior research creates potential (and presumed) risk factors for engaged research with nondefault samples. However, a distant perspective poses risks as well, and particularly so for research with nondefault populations. We suggest that engaged research can usefully encourage attention to the study context and taking the perspective of study samples, both of which are good research practices.

Using growth curve analyses, our results revealed correlated decreases in state self-control capacity and the test-taking effort invested over the course of the test. Furthermore, we found that trait self-control helped to keep state self-control capacity and test-taking effort at a higher level over the course of the test. Our results support the assumption of the process model of self-control that waning self-control capacity is reflected in reduced motivational effort. Furthermore, our findings provide evidence that self-control might play a crucial role in students' test-taking behavior in large-scale assessment studies.

Existing theories suggest that the deterioration of self-regulation is partially shaped by perceptions of effort. Therefore, one promising way to sustain self-regulation may be to cultivate a growth mindset, which has been shown to affect behavior in part by altering effort attributions. Although growth mindsets-the belief that a given trait can be improved through practice-have been studied extensively, particularly in the domain of intelligence, little research has examined the effects of promoting a growth mindset specifically about self-regulation. Here five studies test how promoting a growth mindset of self-regulation impacts actual self-regulation in daily life and the laboratory. In Study 1, relative to an active control that received relationship training, an intensive self-regulation training program emphasizing a growth mindset led participants to persevere longer on impossible anagrams, which was partially mediated by altering attributions of mental fatigue. Relatively, the self-regulation training also led participants to notice more opportunities for self-control in daily life and more successfully resist everyday temptations. The subsequent four studies isolated and abbreviated the growth mindset manipulation, demonstrated improved persistence and decreased effort avoidance, and attempted to further examine the critical mediators. Collectively, results indicate that a growth mindset of self-regulation can change attributions and allocation of effort in meaningful ways that may affect the willingness to attempt challenging tasks and the perseverance required to complete them.",,"[Mrazek, Alissa J.; Ihm, Elliott D.; Mrazek, Michael D.; Zedelius, Claire M.; Schooler, Jonathan W.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Mrazek, Alissa J.; Molden, Daniel C.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Mrazek, Alissa J.; Ihm, Elliott D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,,,,,,,13,,,,,,,"Psychology, Social",WOS:000448093100017,

Previous research has focused on increasing the enactment of interactional justice (i.e., justice as a dependent variable) by enhancing managers' willingness to be fair. Drawing upon the limited strength model of self-regulation, we argue that the enactment of interactional justice may not depend solely on managers' willingness or motivation but also on the extent to which managers have the self-regulatory resources required to engage in these behaviors. Using four experimental studies, our results indicate that the depletion of self-regulatory resources is negatively associated with the enactment of interactional justice. Furthermore, we argue that depletion can give rise to self-appraisal gaps (i.e., individuals' ability to accurately appraise the fairness of their behavior is hampered), which can diminish the impetus to regulate fair behaviors (i.e., diminish interactional justice). Results provide support for self-appraisal gaps as an underlying explanation for why depletion can negatively affect the enactment of interactional justice. Moreover, the negative effects of depletion can be overcome by increasing managers' awareness that they may be overestimating the fairness of their behavior.

We applied the strength model of self-control (e.g., Baumeister & Vohs, 2016; Baumeister et al., 1998) to examine the relationship between self-control strength and performance in real matches. Design and methods: Sixteen soccer referees (M age = 30.06 yrs, SD = 7.38) completed a trait self-control scale. Then, over 2-4 matches they completed measures of daily hassles prior to the match and state self-control prior to and after the match. Personal, situational and performance indices were also collected. Data were analyzed using several statistical procedures, including hierarchical linear modeling. Results: The referees exhibited higher levels of trait self-control compared with professional soccer players and the general population. Their state self-control scores were also high. A noticeable decrease (10% or more) in state self-control strength (i.e., ego depletion) was evident in almost half of the matches. Experience of daily hassles and travel time to the match were related to lower pre-match self-control. Ego depletion was associated with self-reported match difficulty and was negatively related to self-rated match performance.

Based on resource depletion literature, we hypothesized that sleep difficulties lead to cravings. We tested whether sleep quality predicts craving at the within-or between-person level, with perceived willpower as a multilevel mediator. Methods: We used ecological momentary assessments (EMA) to compare two models of temporal precedence. Participants in addiction treatment (N = 122) were sent four surveys each day for three weeks. Participants rated previous night's sleep quality and level of cravings and willpower. Results: The between- (beta = -0.18, SE = 0.06) and within-person (beta = -0.02, SE = 0.02) effects of maximum daily craving on sleep quality were significant, as were the between- (beta = -0.33, SE = 0.08) and within-person (beta = -0.08; SE = 0.03) effects of daily sleep quality on maximum daily cravings. In the mediation analysis of the indirect effect of sleep quality on cravings via willpower, both the indirect effect for the between-person pathway (beta = -0.27, SE = 0.07) and the indirect within -person pathway (beta = -0.01, SE = 0.01) were significant. Conclusions: EMA methodology allowed for disentanglement of the temporal relationship between sleep and cravings.

The vagal tank theory, building on neurophysiological, cognitive and social psychology approaches, will introduce a physiological indicator for self-regulation that has mainly been ignored from cognitive and social psychology, cardiac vagal control (also referred to as cardiac vagal activity). Cardiac vagal control reflects the contribution of the vagus nerve, the main nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system, to cardiac regulation. We propose cardiac vagal control to be an indicator of how efficiently self-regulatory resources are mobilized and used. Three systematic levels of cardiac vagal control analysis are suggested: resting, reactivity, and recovery. Based on this physiological indicator we derive the metaphor of the vagal tank, which can get depleted and replenished. Overall, the vagal tank theory will enable to integrate previous findings from different disciplines and to stimulate new research questions, predictions, and designs regarding self-regulation.",,"[Laborde, Sylvain] German Sport Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Laborde, Sylvain] Normandie Univ, EA 4260, Caen, France; [Mosley, Emma] Southampton Solent Univ, Southampton, Hants, England; [Mosley, Emma] Bournemouth Univ, Bournemouth, Dorset, England; [Mertgen, Alina] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Mertgen, Alina] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany; [Laborde, Sylvain] German Sport Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Laborde, Sylvain] Normandie Univ, EA 4260, Caen, France",,,,,,,,48,,,,,,,Neurosciences,WOS:000438100800001,

Following a discussion of a published large-scale replication study and a review of the meta-analysis literature, we come to the conclusion that many effects are small and that on average the variance of the effects is roughly 10% to 25% of the population variance, most likely because of context dependencies. The proposed explanations such as questionable and suboptimal research practices (low power, poor measurement quality, and the use of NHST) are discussed, as well as more distal explanatory factors such as journals, funding agencies, and institutions. Special attention is given to a third kind of explanatory factor that is situated in a psychological reality that comprises small and varying effect sizes. These factors may cause problems even in the absence of researcher-controlled factors. The proposed remedies for proximal problems insist on more power, more replications, more meta-analysis, higher reliability coefficients, and alternatives for NHST. Based on a discussion we formulate critical and less critical remarks regarding these recommendations. We believe there should be room for a diversity of perspectives and approaches. Small and varying effects attributable to complexity and context dependency of human behavior are considered to be great challenges and may lead to an adjustment of research and analysis methods.

Second, the underlying nature of SDWB is not well understood by management scientists. To stimulate management research on a costly and arguably understudied construct, we provide a definition of SDWB and use the definition to clarify relations between SDWB and DWB. We then proffer two research propositions to guide future management research based on two salient attributes of SDWB: 1) self-regulation failure, and 2) the habitual nature of SDWB.

While we find strong support for rejecting the notion that self-interest is always intuitive, the literature has reached conflicting conclusions about the neurocognitive systems underpinning fairness. We propose that this disagreement can largely be resolved in light of an extended Social Heuristics Hypothesis. Divergent findings may be attributed to the interpretation of behavioral effects of ego depletion or neurostimulation, reverse inference from brain activity to the underlying psychological process, and insensitivity to social context and inter-individual differences.

Typically, these accounts are based on a sequential task methodology where an initial task is presented to deplete self-regulatory resources, and carryover effects are then examined on a second outcome task. In the aftermath of high profile replication failures using a popular letter-crossing task as a means of depleting self-regulatory resources and subsequent criticisms of that task, current research into self-control is currently at an impasse. This is largely due to the lack of empirical research that tests explicit assumptions regarding the initial task. One such untested assumption is that for resource depletion to occur, the initial task must first establish an habitual response and then this habitual response must be inhibited, with behavioral inhibition being the causal factor in inducing depletion. This study reports on four experiments exploring performance on a letter-canceling task, where the rules for target identification remained constant but the method of responding differed (Experiment 1) and the coherence of the text was manipulated (Experiments 1-4). Experiment 1 established that habit forming and behavioral inhibition did not produce any performance decrement when the targets were embedded in random letter strings.

A laboratory experiment (N = 105) induced a state of ego depletion (i.e., impaired self-control) by having some participants continuously break pre-established motoric habits, and afterward these participants were less willing to make plans for the next four weeks than control participants. A field experiment (N = 112) used a naturally occurring induction of decision fatigue (IKEA shopping) and again found that ego depletion reduced planning. Specifically, fatigued shoppers exiting the store expressed more reluctance to make long-term plans than shoppers who were just arriving at the store. A final laboratory experiment (N = 128) found that ego-depleted participants were only half as likely to choose a planning task as control participants, and identified effort avoidance as a mediator mechanism. Crucially, the three experimental manipulations were longer and stronger than the 5-min depletion tasks often used in previous research (24 min; 2 h; 30 min), and manipulation checks confirmed severe and significant ego depletion.

We then discuss causality from a network perspective, which sees personality as a phenomenon that emerges from a network of behaviours and environments over time. From a methodological perspective, we propose a three-step strategy to investigate causality: (1) identify a candidate target for manipulation (e.g. using network analysis), (2) identify and test a manipulation (e.g. using laboratory research), and (3) deliver the manipulation repeatedly for a congruous amount of time (e.g. using ecological momentary interventions) and evaluate its ability to generate trait change.

First, I measure commitment demand by eliciting subjects' preferences over menus that did or did not allow access to the story. I then implement preferences using a random mechanism, allowing to observe subjects who faced the choice yet preferred commitment. A quarter to a third of subjects can be classified as self-control types according to their menu preferences. When confronted with the choice, virtually all of them behaved as they anticipated and resisted temptation. These findings suggest that policies restricting the availability of tempting options could have larger welfare benefits than predicted by standard models of present bias.",,"[Toussaert, Severine] London Sch Econ, Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, London, England; [Toussaert, Severine] London Sch Econ, Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, London, England",,,,,,,,18,,,,,,,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",WOS:000434093400003,

However, theoretical frameworks for understanding sexual risk behavior have generally neglected neurocognitive constructs, and beyond a few studies of individuals selected for high substance use, the literature contains virtually no research on this topic with other adults at risk for HIV infection, such as men who have sex with men (MSM). Purpose This study tested whether EF was associated with condomless anal intercourse (CAI) among MSM. Methods Seventy MSM completed cognitive tests assessing EF at two time points-baseline, and approximately 30 min later after engaging in a stressful interpersonal task. Men also reported their sexual behaviors over the past 3 months, including the frequency of CAI. Results Baseline EF was unrelated to CAI. However, CAI was associated with the degree to which performance improved from baseline to post-stressor administration. Compared with norms for practice effects, men who reported CAI improved less than expected from baseline to post-stressor EF performance, whereas men who reported no CAI exhibited a more normative practice effect. Conclusions MSM with histories of greater sexual risk improved less than anticipated from baseline to post-stressor on tests of EF, suggesting that they might be more cognitively depleted by the stressful interpersonal task they engaged in between administrations. It is possible that certain individuals struggle to maintain executive control in stressful interpersonal situations, a finding that could contribute to the difficulty some individuals face executing precautionary behaviors during a sexual encounter.",,"[Huebner, David M.] George Washington Univ, Dept Prevent & Community Hlth, Washington, DC USA; [McGarrity, Larissa A.; Smith, Timothy W.; Perry, Nicholas S.; Suchy, Yana] Univ Utah, Dept Psychol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Huebner, David M.] George Washington Univ, Dept Prevent & Community Hlth, Washington, DC USA",,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000431187100006,

Previous research has suggested that ego depletion not only interferes with subsequent self-control but also with working memory. However, recent meta-analytical evidence casts doubt onto this. The present study tackles the question if ego depletion does interfere with working memory performance. We induced ego depletion in two ways: using an e-crossing task and using a Stroop task. We then measured working memory performance using the letter-number sequencing task. There was no evidence of ego depletion interfering with working memory performance. Several aspects of our study render this null finding highly robust. We had a large and heterogeneous sample of N = 1,385, which provided sufficient power. We deployed established depletion tasks from two task families (e-crossing task and Stroop), thus making it less likely that the null finding is due to a specific depletion paradigm. We derived several performance scores from the working memory task and ran different analyses to maximize the chances of finding an effect. Lastly, we controlled for two potential moderators, the implicit theories about willpower and dispositional self-control capacity, to ensure that a possible effect on working memory is not obscured by an interaction effect.

AB has traditionally been measured using reaction time in response to a stimulus. Novel methods for AB measurement include eye tracking to measure visual fixation on a stimulus, and electroencephalography to measure brain activation in response to a stimulus. This systematic review summarizes, critiques, and integrates data on AB gathered using the above-mentioned methods in those with binge eating behaviors, including binge eating, loss of control eating, and bulimia nervosa. Method: Literature searches on PubMed and Psyclnfo were conducted using combinations of terms related to binge eating and biobehavioral AB paradigms. Studies using AB paradigms with three categories of stimuli were included: food, weight/shape, and threat. For studies reporting means and standard deviations of group bias scores, Hedges' g effect sizes for group differences in AB were calculated. Results: Fifty articles met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Individuals who binge eat in the absence of compensatory behaviors show an increased AB to food cues, but few studies have examined such individuals' AB toward weight/shape and threatening stimuli. Individuals with bulimia nervosa consistently show an increased AB to shape/weight cues and socially threatening stimuli, but findings for AB to food cues are mixed. Discussion: While there are important research gaps, preliminary evidence suggests that the combination of AB to disorder-specific cues (i.e., food and weight/shape) and AB toward threat may be a potent contributor to binge eating. This conclusion underscores previous findings on the interaction between negative affect and AB to disorder-specific cues. Recommendations for future research are provided. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In the current study, 84 female restrained and unrestrained eaters engaged in a self-control or neutral task, followed by a measure of attentional bias and an eating task. Results indicated there were no differences in attentional bias or amount eaten between self-control conditions and dietary restraint groups. However, a moderated regression showed that attentional bias toward food or self-control images predicted eating behavior only in participants who previously exerted self-control, while no effect was found for participants in the neutral condition.

In an experience sampling study, we apply hierarchical linear modeling to analyze 396 observations from 44 executives. Our multilevel moderated mediation analyses reveal that authentic leadership reduces leaders' stress and increases their work engagement and that these effects are mediated by leader mental depletion.

The qualitative data for this analysis are derived from 60 years' experience in outdoor adventure activities, and similar to 30,000 person-hours of participant observation.

The mechanisms explaining why self-control is reduced following prior use currently remain unclear. This study, therefore, explored whether exerting self-control (a) reduces performance, (b) increases perceptions of pain, and (c) reduces motivation during a subsequent, unrelated physical task that requires self-control. In a within subject design, 55 individuals completed an easy (congruent) Stroop task (no self-control) or a difficult (incongruent) Stroop task (self-control). Participants were then required to perform a lower limb endurance task (i.e., a ""wall-sit"") until volitional exhaustion and their perception of pain and motivation were recorded during the task. When participants completed the difficult Stroop task, wall-sit time to volitional exhaustion was reduced (133.33 +/- 70.28 s) compared to when they completed the easy Stroop task (150.49 +/- 69.97 s, P = 0.04). Motivation during the early stages of the wall-sit task explained the reductions in performance (P < 0.001). The results suggest that motivation to perform task goals may be an important explanatory mechanism behind performance decrements on physical tasks following the exertion of self-control.",,"[Boat, Ruth; Atkins, Todd; Davenport, Nathan; Cooper, Simon] Nottingham Trent Univ, Dept Sport Sci, Sport Hlth & Performance Enhancement Res Ctr, Nottingham, England; [Boat, Ruth] Nottingham Trent Univ, Dept Sport Sci, Sport Hlth & Performance Enhancement Res Ctr, Nottingham, England",,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,Neurosciences; Sport Sciences,WOS:000452416200003,

The objective of this paper is to present a model that builds on and extends foundational theory and research to suggest novel approaches that may help to produce lasting behaviour change. The model aims to integrate factors not typically examined together in order to elucidate potential processes underlying a shift from behaviour initiation to long-term maintenance. The central premise of the Maintain IT model builds on approaches demonstrating that in-tact executive function (EF) is critical for health behaviour initiation, for more complex behaviours beyond initiation, and in unsupportive environments and circumstances, but successful recruitment of EF is effortful and prone to error. Enduring changes are more likely if the underlying cognitive processes can become less effortful (non-conscious, automatic). The Maintain IT model posits that a centred identity transformation is one path leading to less effortful processing and facilitating successful recruitment of EF when necessary over the long term, increasing the sustainability of health behaviour change. A conceptual overview of the literature supporting the utility of this integrative model, future directions, and anticipated challenges are presented.",,"[Caldwell, Ann E.; Masters, Kevin S.; Peters, John C.; Wyatt, Holly R.; Hill, James O.] Univ Colorado, Colorado Nutr Obes Res Ctr, Anschutz Med Campus, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Masters, Kevin S.; Grigsby, Jim; Hooker, Stephanie A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Peters, John C.; Grigsby, Jim; Wyatt, Holly R.; Hill, James O.] Univ Colorado, Dept Med, Anschutz Med Campus, Denver, CO USA; [Bryan, Angela D.] Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Hill, James O.] Univ Colorado, Dept Pediat, Anschutz Med Campus, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Caldwell, Ann E.] Univ Colorado, Colorado Nutr Obes Res Ctr, Anschutz Med Campus, Denver, CO 80202 USA",,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical",WOS:000441052500002,

Self-control strength was measured using a handgrip task. Findings Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that self-leadership, quantitative overload, and qualitative overload were not directly associated with self-control strength at either of the two measurement occasions. Qualitative overload moderated the relationship between self-leadership and self-control strength, such that self-leadership was associated with lower self-control strength at both measurement occasions when individuals experienced high qualitative overload in the morning.

Personal conflict activates the behavioral inhibition system (BIS; Hirsh, Mar, & Peterson, 2012), which may make it harder for participants to successfully execute self-control. In this large (N = 337), pre-registered study participants in the conflict condition performed worse on anagrams than participants in the clarity condition, and the effect of condition on anagram performance was mediated by a subjective uncertainty measure of BIS activation. This suggests that BIS activation leads to poor self-control.

Materials and methods: One hundred and fifty RA patients (8 males, 142 females; mean age 51.1 +/- 12.7 years; range 21 to 81 years) were included in the study. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the factor structure of the IPQ-R. Pain was assessed by visual analog scale, disease activity by Disease Activity Score 28, depression by Beck Depression Inventory, global life satisfaction by the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and illness perception by the IPQ-R. Results: Three items (items 12, 18, 19) were deleted because of poor factor loadings. The modified 35-item model showed good reliability and discriminant validity. Beck Depression Inventory scores were correlated with identity, consequences, and emotional representations subscales positively (p<0.001); and with illness coherence subscale negatively (p<0.05). There were positive correlations between Satisfaction with Life Scale scores, and treatment control and illness coherence subscales (p<0.05).

In addition to mnemonic demands, prior studies suggest that internal sources of distraction, such as mind wandering (i.e., having off-task thoughts) and greater time on task, may tax executive resources. Herein, the consequences of mnemonic demand, mind wandering, and time on task were investigated during a visual working memory task. Participants (N = 143) completed a delayed-recognition visual working memory task, with mnemonic load for visual objects manipulated across trials (1 item = low load; 2 items = high load) and subjective mind wandering assessed intermittently throughout the experiment using a self-report Likert-type scale (1 = on-task, 6 = off-task). Task performance (correct/incorrect response) and self-reported mind wandering data were evaluated by hierarchical linear modeling to track trial-by-trial fluctuations. Performance declined with greater time on task, and the rate of decline was steeper for high vs low load trials. Self-reported mind wandering increased over time, and significantly varied as a function of both load and time on task. Participants reported greater mind wandering at the beginning of the experiment for low vs. high load trials; however, with greater time on task, more mind wandering was reported during high vs. low load trials. These results suggest that the availability of executive resources in support of working memory maintenance processes fluctuates in a demand-sensitive manner with time on task, and may be commandeered by mind wandering.",,"[Krimsky, Marissa; Forster, Daniel E.; Llabre, Maria M.; Jha, Amishi P.] Univ Miami, Dept Psychol, 5665 Ponce Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Jha, Amishi P.] Univ Miami, Dept Psychol, 5665 Ponce Leon Blvd, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA",,,,,,,,19,,,,,,,"Psychology, Experimental",WOS:000413280400008,

The mental health of refugees, especially of unaccompanied minors (70% between the ages of 16 and 18 years) who have been exposed to traumatic events (e.g., war), is generally impaired with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. Several studies revealed (1) a huge variation among the prevalence rates of these mental problems, and (2) that post-migration stressors (e.g., language barriers, cultural differences) might be at least as detrimental to mental health as the traumatic events in pre- and peri-flight. As psychotherapy is a limited resource that should be reserved for severe cases and as language trainings are often publicly offered for refugees, we recommend focusing on intercultural competence, emotion regulation, and goal setting and goal striving in primary support programs: Intercultural competence fosters adaptation by giving knowledge about cultural differences in values and norms. Emotion regulation regarding empathy, positive reappraisal, and cultural differences in emotion expression fosters both adaptation and mental health. Finally, supporting unaccompanied refugee minors in their goal setting and goal striving is necessary, as they carry many unrealistic wishes and unattainable goals, which can be threatening to their mental health.

Next, they made explicit self-evaluations of their body appearance anxiety.

This study, therefore, explored whether a) prior self-control exertion reduces subsequent persistence on a physically demanding task, and b) whether any observed performance decrements could be explained by changes in perceptions of pain. Method: In a within-subject design, sixty-three individuals completed an easy (congruent) Stroop task or a difficult (incongruent) Stroop task that required self-control. Participants were then required to remain in a physically demanding posture (i.e., a 'wall-sit') until voluntary exhaustion and their perception of pain was recorded during the task. Results: When participants completed the difficult Stroop task, they quit the wall-sit sooner. This decrement in performance was explained by greater perceptions of pain at the beginning of the wall-sit. Conclusions: Perceptions of pain may, therefore, be an important attentional mechanism explaining why self-control use interferes with subsequent persistence during physically effortful tasks.

The testing window consisted of 2-min blocks of the Stroop/filler task separated by 30-s rest periods in which affective valence and mental fatigue were assessed. Results showed handgrip endurance performance was uniformly unaffected following 0 to 4 min and uniformly impaired following 6 to 10 min of exerting cognitive control.

There is little evidence on the causal mechanisms through which impulsivity influences drinking or how they are affected by key social factors (peer influence). This study reports the development of the first comprehensive laboratory model of adolescent impulsivity and alcohol use. One hundred and twenty adolescents (50% female). of legal drinking age (M = 19.47 years, SD = 1.12) in Australia (18+ years) were subjected to 1 of 3 experimental manipulations to increase impulsive behavior (reward cue exposure, negative mood induction, ego depletion). Changes in disinhibition (stop signal task) and reward-seeking (BAS-Fun Seeking) were measured before completing a laboratory drinking task alone or with a heavy-drinking confederate. Reward cue exposure increased alcohol consumption, with the effect mediated by increased reward-seeking. Negative mood induction increased disinhibition, but not drinking. The presence of a heavy-drinking peer directly increased alcohol consumption in an additive fashion. Findings provide causal evidence that extends survey-based research by highlighting the role of reward-related impulsivity in adolescent alcohol use. The new laboratory model can provide novel insights into the psychological processes underlying adolescent impulsivity and impulsivity-related drinking. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It has however remained unclear whether self-referred decisions truly impair behavioral control even in seemingly unrelated cognitive domains, and which neurophysiological mechanisms are affected by these potential depletion effects. In the current study, we therefore used an inter-individual design to compare two kinds of depletion, namely a self-referred choice-based depletion and a categorization-based switching depletion, to a non-depleted control group. We used a backward inhibition (BI) paradigm to assess the effects of depletion on task switching and associated inhibition processes. It was combined with EEG and source localization techniques to assess both behavioral and neurophysiological depletion effects. The results challenge the ego depletion theory in its current form: Opposing the theory's prediction of a general limited resource, which should have yielded comparable effects in both depletion groups, or maybe even a larger depletion in the self-referred choice group, there were stronger performance impairments following a task domain-specific depletion (i.e., the switching-based depletion) than following a depletion based on self-referred choices.

Five studies test one key, untested assumption underpinning strength (finite resource) models of self-regulation: Performance will decline over time on a task that depletes self-regulatory resources. In the aftermath of high profile replication failures using a popular letter-crossing task and subsequent criticisms of that task, the current studies examined whether depletion effects would occur in real time using letter-crossing tasks that did not invoke habit-forming and breaking, and whether these effects were moderated by administration type (paper and pencil vs. computer administration). Sample makeup and sizes as well as response formats were also varied across the studies. The five studies yielded a clear and consistent pattern of increasing performance deficits (errors) as a function of time spent on task with generally large effects and in the fifth study the strength of negative transfer effects to a working memory task were related to individual differences in depletion. These results demonstrate that some form of depletion is occurring on letter-crossing tasks though whether an internal regulatory resource reservoir or some other factor is changing across time remains an important question for future research.",,"[Tehan, Gerald] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Psychol & Counselling, Springfield, Qld, Australia; Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Resilient Reg, Springfield, Qld, Australia; [Tehan, Gerald] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Psychol & Counselling, Springfield, Qld, Australia",,,,,,,,10,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000411697700001,

With the touch of a button or a simple voice command, we can instantly order groceries, get directions, or find the nearest sushi restaurant. Sensibly, the private sector has capitalized on these recent innovations to drive up profits. To sell more laundry detergent, Amazon now enables consumers to order refills by simply pressing the ""dash button"" mounted above their laundry machines. Starbucks lures more customers by allowing them to pre-order online and have their drink waiting when they arrive at the store. The theory behind this approach is simple: if you want someone to use your product or service, you should make it as quick and easy as possible for them to do so. This Article makes a novel argument to extend this line of reasoning to encourage better compliance with the tax laws. In making this argument, the Article draws upon behavioral science research showing that complexity impacts individuals' decision making and encourages dishonesty. The Article then offers a number of proposals for how policy makers could simplify individuals' interactions with the tax system. For example, the IRS could allow taxpayers to easily record their income and deductions online during the year using smart phones or tablets. Those items could be stored in an online personal taxpayer account and, at the end of the year, automatically uploaded to an electronic return. Easing the burden of taxpaying should encourage more taxpayers to report honestly, in addition to reducing their compliance costs.

Recent advances in research on the connection between selfcontrol and moral behavior indicate that low self-control is associated with increased dishonesty. From an evolutionary perspective, when mating motivation is activated, men may behave in dishonest ways by projecting characteristics in line with women's mate preferences to enhance their sexual attractiveness. We tested the possibility that exposure to pictures of sexually appealing women would engender lower self-control, leading men to behave dishonestly. The results showed that a state of lower self-control was observed in males who viewed women rated high on sexual attractiveness but not in males who viewed women rated low on sexual attractiveness or in females who viewed men (Experiment 1). Compared with control participants, male participants exposed to pictures of sexy women were less likely to return excess money received for participating (Experiment 2) and more likely to cheat in a matrix task (Experiments 3 and 4). State self-control mediated the link between exposure to sexual stimuli and dishonest behavior in men (Experiments 2 and 4). For men whose mating motivation is heightened by exposure to sexual stimuli, dishonesty appears to be a tactic for projecting characteristics preferred by women (e.g., large economic resources).

In this study, we investigate whether the effect of peers on late adolescent males is exacerbated when youth are cognitively fatigued, a state characterized by weakened cognitive control and heightened orientation toward rewards, and well established as a factor that compromises decision making. We hypothesized that fatigued adolescents' top-down regulation of reward-related impulses may be compromised, thereby potentially amplifying the effect of peers on reward- and risk-seeking behavior. Late adolescent males between 18 and 22 years old (mean age = 19.64, SD = 1.22; 61% Caucasian) completed a decision-making battery either alone or in the presence of 3 same-sex peers, and were either cognitively fatigued or non-fatigued. We compared behavior between four experimental groups-fatigued adolescents in a peer group, non-fatigued adolescents in a peer group, fatigued adolescents by themselves, and non-fatigued adolescents by themselves. The findings showed that cognitive fatigue and peer presence evinced independent effects on risk taking and sensitivity to rewards, but that these factors do not influence adolescent decision-making in an additive or synergistic fashion. To our surprise, being fatigued reduces (but does not eliminate) the effect of peers of risk taking. Moreover, the impact of peers on adolescent males' ability to learn from negative consequences is not compromised when adolescents are in a state of mental fatigue. Our results suggest that mental fatigue increases late adolescent males' reward sensitivity to the same extent as peer presence, but does not amplify the peer effect on risk-taking behavior. In this regard, grouping adolescents when they are fatigued may be less dangerous than when they are rested. Similarly, the added presence of peers does not further exacerbate the effect of fatigue on adolescent's reward- and risk-seeking inclinations. In fact, given peers' unique effect on adolescents' ability to learn from costly decisions, our findings suggest that seeking the presence of peers-which is often a rewarding experience in and of itself-may be an adaptive response to mitigate the impact of fatigue on decision making.",,"[Silva, Karol; Chein, Jason; Steinberg, Laurence] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Patrianakos, Jamie] Loyola Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL USA; [Steinberg, Laurence] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental",WOS:000407995500002,

Objective Our objective was to evaluate the literature on impairment of physical performance due to mental fatigue and to create an overview of the potential factors underlying this effect. Methods Two electronic databases, PubMed and Web of Science (until 28 April 2016), were searched for studies designed to test whether mental fatigue influenced performance of a physical task or influenced physiological and/or perceptual responses during the physical task. Studies using short (<30 min) self-regulatory depletion tasks were excluded from the review. Results A total of 11 articles were included, of which six were of strong and five of moderate quality. The general finding was a decline in endurance performance (decreased time to exhaustion and self-selected power output/velocity or increased completion time) associated with a higher than normal perceived exertion. Physiological variables traditionally associated with endurance performance (heart rate, blood lactate, oxygen uptake, cardiac output, maximal aerobic capacity) were unaffected by mental fatigue. Maximal strength, power, and anaerobic work were not affected by mental fatigue.

Given its centrality to understanding the human condition, a large body of research has examined cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects of self-regulation. In contrast, relatively little attention has been paid to specific biologic processes that may underlie self-regulation. We address this latter issue in the present review by examining the growing body of research showing that components of the immune system involved in inflammation can alter neural, cognitive, and motivational processes that lead to impaired self-regulation and poor health. Based on these findings, we propose an integrated, multilevel model that describes how inflammation may cause widespread biobehavioral alterations that promote self-regulatory failure.

Previous research has established that adults' tendency to deploy EF can be temporarily diminished by use. Exercising self-control in one context decreases adults' performance on other EF demanding tasks immediately thereafter. Using two different depletion methods, Experiments 1 and 3 extend this finding to preschool-aged children. Experiments 2 and 4 make use of these EF depletion methods to elucidate the role of EF in children's theory of mind reasoning. Experiment 2 shows that EF depletion affects 5-year-olds' ability to predict another's behavior on the basis of that person's false belief, and Experiment 4 shows that this negative effect of depletion extends to 4- and 5-year-olds' ability to explain others' behavior on the basis of their false beliefs. These findings provide direct evidence that EF is required for the expression of an understanding of others' false beliefs across a variety of task demands, even in children who clearly have the capacity to construct such representations. We suggest ways in which depletion may be used as a tool for further investigating the role of executive function in cognitive development.

In typical laboratory paradigms, participants complete a task that places demand on these self-control processes and are later given a subsequent task. Generally speaking, decrements to subsequent task performance are taken as evidence that the initial task created mental fatigue through the continued engagement of motivational and executive functions. Several models have been developed to account for negative transfer resulting from this ""ego depletion.""

Important evidence for this claim comes from a large meta-analysis by Anderson and colleagues (2010), who found effects of violent games in experimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal research. In that meta-analysis, the authors argued that there is little publication or analytic bias in the literature, an argument supported by their use of the trim-and-fill procedure. In the present manuscript, we reexamine their meta-analysis using a wider array of techniques for detecting bias and adjusting effect sizes. Our conclusions differ from those of Anderson and colleagues in 3 salient ways. First, we detect substantial publication bias in experimental research on the effects of violent games on aggressive affect and aggressive behavior. Second, after adjustment for bias, the effects of violent games on aggressive behavior in experimental research are estimated as being very small, and estimates of effects on aggressive affect are much reduced. In contrast, the cross-sectional literature finds correlations that appear largely unbiased. Third, experiments meeting the original authors' criteria for methodological quality do not yield larger adjusted effects than other experiments, but instead yield larger indications of bias, indicating that perhaps they were selected for significance. We outline future directions for stronger experimental research.

Such claims, however, cannot be made because (1) scientific method itself is seriously limited (i.e., it can never prove a negative); (2) non-existence of phenomena would require a complete absence of both logical (theoretical) and empirical support; even if empirical support is weak, logical and theoretical support can be strong; (3) statistical data are only one piece of evidence and cannot be used to reduce psychological phenomena to statistical phenomena; and (4) psychological phenomena vary across time, situations and persons. The human mind is unreproducible from one situation to another. Psychological phenomena are not particles that can decisively be tested and discovered. Therefore, a declaration that a phenomenon is not real is not only theoretically and empirically unjustified but runs counter to the propositional and provisional nature of scientific knowledge. There are only ""temporary winners"" and no ""final truths"" in scientific knowledge. Psychology is a science of subtleties in human affect, cognition and behavior. Its phenomena fluctuate with conditions and may sometimes be difficult to detect and reproduce empirically. When strictly applied, reproducibility is an overstated and even questionable concept in psychological science. Furthermore, statistical measures (e.g., effect size) are poor indicators of the theoretical importance and relevance of phenomena (cf. ""deliberate practice"" vs. ""talent"" in expert performance), not to mention whether phenomena are real or unreal.

The present paper is concerned with examining the issue of replicability in the field of social psychology. We begin by drawing a state of the art of the crisis in this field. We then highlight some possible causes for the crisis, discussing topics of statistical power, questionable research practices, publication standards, and hidden auxiliary assumptions of context-dependency of social psychological theories.

However, studies have not yet provided convincing evidence that perception itself is directly involved in everyday behaviors such as eating. We suggest that this issue can be resolved by employing the dual systems account of human behavior. We tested the link between perceived distance to candies and their consumption for participants who were tired or depleted (impulsive system), versus those who were not (reflective system). Perception predicted eating only when participants were tired (Experiment 1) or depleted (Experiments 2 and 3). In contrast, a rational determinant of behavior eating restraint towards candies predicted eating for non-depleted individuals (Experiment 2). Finally, Experiment 3 established that perceived distance was correlated with participants' self-reported motivation to consume candies.

The Self-Control Strength model, which proposes that self-control is dependent upon limited resources and susceptible to fatigue, may offer insight into relapse processes. The current study tested the hypothesis that self-control depletion (SCD), produced from engagement in emotional suppression, would serve as a novel antecedent for cessation failure, as indexed by a validated laboratory analogue of smoking lapse and relapse. We also examined whether SCD effects interacted with those of a well-established relapse precipitant (i.e., nicotine deprivation). Craving and behavioral economic indices (delay discounting and demand) were tested as hypothesized mechanisms for increased cessation failure. Ultimately, a moderated mediation model was used to test nicotine deprivation as a hypothesized moderator of SCD effects. Method: We used a 2 x 2 (12-hr deprivation vs. no deprivation; SCD vs. no SCD) factorial between-subjects design (N = 128 smokers). Results: The primary hypothesis of the study was supported, as SCD increased lapse behavior (p = .04). Nicotine deprivation significantly increased craving, cigarette demand, delay discounting, and lapse behavior. No main effects were found for SCD on putative mediators (i.e., craving, demand, and discounting), but the SCD and deprivation manipulations interacted upon craving (p = .04). The moderated mediation model was significant. SCD was found to increase craving among nicotine deprived smokers, which mediated effects on lapse behavior.

Methods: The present review attempts to move that discussion forward by noting key sources of prior confusion such as measurement-concept confounding, and then arguing the following major points. Results: First, the field needs a domain-general construct of SR that encompasses SR of action, emotion, and cognition and involves both top-down and bottom-up regulatory processes. This does not assume a shared core process across emotion, action, and cognition, but is intended to provide clarity on the extent of various claims about kinds of SR. Second, top-down aspects of SR need to be integrated. These include (a) basic processes that develop early and address immediate conflict signals, such as cognitive control and effortful control (EC), and (b) complex cognition and strategies for addressing future conflict, represented by the regulatory application of complex aspects of executive functioning. Executive function (EF) and cognitive control are not identical to SR because they can be used for other activities, but account for top-down aspects of SR at the cognitive level. Third, impulsivity, risk-taking, and disinhibition are distinct although overlapping; a taxonomy of the kinds of breakdowns of SR associated with psychopathology requires their differentiation. Fourth, different aspects of the SR universe can be organized hierarchically in relation to granularity, development, and time. Low-level components assemble into high-level components. This hierarchical perspective is consistent across literatures. Conclusions: It is hoped that the framework outlined here will facilitate integration and cross-talk among investigators working from different perspectives, and facilitate individual differences research on how SR relates to developmental psychopathology.",,"[Nigg, Joel T.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97219 USA; [Nigg, Joel T.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97219 USA",,,,,,,,334,,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental; Psychiatry; Psychology",WOS:000398122800004,

Although evidence is ambiguous, behavioural studies have repeatedly suggested that control-demanding tasks seem to deplete a limited cache of self-regulatory resources leading to performance degradations and fatigue. While resource depletion has indirectly been associated with a decline in right prefrontal cortex capacity, its precise neural underpinnings have not yet been revealed. This study consisted of two independent experiments, which set out to investigate the causal role of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in a classic dual phase depletion paradigm employing non-invasive brain stimulation. In Experiment 1 we demonstrated a general depletion effect, which was significantly eliminated by anodal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation to the right DLPFC. In Experiment 2, however, we failed to replicate the basic psychological depletion effect within a second independent sample. The dissimilar results are discussed in the context of the current 'replication crisis' and suggestions for future studies are offered. While our current results do not allow us to firmly argue for or against the existence of resource depletion, we outline why it is crucial to further clarify which specific external and internal circumstances lead to limited replicability of the described effect.

This study explored a) whether this effect occurs during a well-practiced endurance task, b) the potential for glucose supplementation to moderate this effect, and c) whether this effect differed over time. Method: Fourteen trained cyclists completed four simulated 16 km time trials on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer. Prior to each time trial, participants completed a congruent Stroop task or an incongruent Stroop task that required self-control. They also received either a glucose-based drink or placebo. Participants' performance time and heart rate were recorded throughout the time trials. Results: Multilevel growth curve analysis revealed a significant three-way interaction between self-control, glucose, and time (b = -0.91; p = 0.02). When participants did not exert self-control (congruent Stroop) or consume glucose (placebo drink) they were slowest during the early stages of the time trial but quickest over the full distance. No differences were found in heart rate across the four conditions. Conclusions: Findings suggest that pacing may explain why self-control exertion interferes with endurance performance.

The utility of research depends on whether it makes a contribution because it is original or can add to cumulative research efforts, is rigorously and reliably done, and is able to inform basic or applied research and later policy. However, five serious ""diseases"" stifle the production of useful research. These diseases include: significosis, an inordinate focus on statistically significant results; neophilia, an excessive appreciation for novelty; theorrhea, a mania for new theory; arigorium, a deficiency of rigor in theoretical and empirical work; and finally, disjunctivitis, a proclivity to produce large quantities of redundant, trivial, and incoherent works.

I discuss what publication gatekeepers should do to eradicate these diseases, to stimulate the undertaking of more useful and impactful research, and to provide the needed incentives to better align the interests of researchers with those of the greater good. Finally, I highlight where technical improvements are needed to enhance research quality, and call on deeper reflection, transparency, and honesty in how we do research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It has been proposed that ego-depletion increases approach motivation which would amplify positive emotions to appetitive cues. Here we investigated the effect of the depletion of cognitive self-control on the subsequent emotional evaluation of appetitive cues. Participants of the depletion group copied a text omitting frequent letters and thereby exerting self-control to inhibit automated writing habits. Participants of the control group just copied the text. In a subsequent task participants had to rate valence and arousal of their responses to neutral vs. positive pictures of humans, animals, food, or sceneries. Ego-depletion caused more positive valence ratings of neutral pictures and lower arousal ratings of positive pictures. The findings do not support the notion that ego-depletion increases approach motivation in general. Rather they suggest that-without a specific motivational context-depletion of cognitive self-control differentially alters the immediate emotional evaluation of appetitive cues.",,"[Wiesner, Christian Dirk] Univ Kiel, Sch Med, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Ctr Integrat Psychiat, Kiel, Germany; [Lindner, Christoph] IPN, Leibniz Inst Sci Math Educ, Kiel, Germany; [Lindner, Christoph] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Wiesner, Christian Dirk] Univ Kiel, Sch Med, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Ctr Integrat Psychiat, Kiel, Germany; [Lindner, Christoph] IPN, Leibniz Inst Sci Math Educ, Kiel, Germany; [Lindner, Christoph] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany",,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,WOS:000396129500008,

Although most researchers agree that mental effort is aversive and stems from limitations in our capacity to exercise cognitive control, it is unclear what gives rise to those limitations and why they result in an experience of control as costly. The presence of these control costs also raises further questions regarding how best to allocate mental effort to minimize those costs and maximize the attendant benefits. This review explores recent advances in computational modeling and empirical research aimed at addressing these questions at the level of psychological process and neural mechanism, examining both the limitations to mental effort exertion and how we manage those limited cognitive resources.

Each of these in situ factors - the availability of the tempting object, one's desire for it, and impaired affective and cognitive functioning (most notably from sleep-related fatigue, daily 'wear and tear', and intoxication) - makes self-regulation more difficult, and even more so when they co-occur. This integrative paper highlights how time of day modulates the salience of these impairing factors and argues that they are likely to be especially influential on self-regulation at night, or later in one's waking day. As each factor is likely to vary considerably across the 24 hours of a day, so too will one's self-regulatory ability and motivation - although person-level characteristics such as chronotype may shift these time-based considerations. The paper thus emphasises the importance of clocking self-regulation within health psychology research and intervention design. Consideration of when a self-regulation attempt is being made and of how time of day (or night) may be altering both the person and the situation towards risk, will facilitate a more temporally contextualised account of self-regulation.",,"[Millar, Brett M.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Hlth Psychol & Clin Sci Doctoral Program, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Millar, Brett M.] CUNY Hunter Coll, Ctr HIV AIDS Educ Studies & Training CHEST, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Millar, Brett M.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Hlth Psychol & Clin Sci Doctoral Program, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Millar, Brett M.] CUNY Hunter Coll, Ctr HIV AIDS Educ Studies & Training CHEST, New York, NY 10021 USA",,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical",WOS:000423525600003,

Using behavioural manipulations, reactivated memories may be disrupted via the mechanism of interference (i.e. novel learning). In a laboratory study, Wichert et al. (2013a) showed that new learning after reactivation changed episodic memory, while new learning alone or reactivation alone did not. Objective: Given the potential clinical application of such a procedure in trauma-focused psychological treatments, such as CBT or EMDR, the aim of this study was to replicate Wichert et al. Method: On Day 1, participants (N = 96) viewed and recalled a series of emotional and non-emotional pictures. Then, participants were randomized to one of four groups. One week later, on Day 8, Group 1 reactivated the previously learned pictures and learned new pictures. To control for specific effects of reactivation or new learning, Group 2 only reactivated the previously learned pictures, and Group 3 only learned new pictures. Group 4 received no reactivation and no new learning. On Day 9, all groups indicated for each picture out of a series whether they had seen it on Day 1. Results: The data were analysed using Bayesian hypothesis testing, which allows for quantifying the evidence in favour of the alternative and the null hypothesis. In general, results showed that Group 1 recognized fewer pictures from Day 1 compared to Groups 2 and 4 on Day 9. However, the expected difference between new learning following reactivation (i.e. Group 1) and new learning alone (i.e. Group 3) was not substantially supported by the data for any of our dependent measures. Conclusions: We replicated some of the findings by Wichert et al., but did not find substantial support for the critical difference between new learning following reactivation and new learning alone.",,"[van Schie, Kevin; van Veen, Suzanne C.; van den Hout, Marcel A.; Engelhard, Iris M.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Clin Psychol, Heidelberglaan 1, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Schie, Kevin] Univ Utrecht, Dept Clin Psychol, Heidelberglaan 1, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical; Psychiatry",WOS:000419656000003,

Call this the logical criterion. This is especially difficult to do with clear-minded, intentional incontinence since we have to explain how two judgments can have non-contradicting contents yet still aim at contradictory outcomes. Davidson devises an innovative way of doing this but compromises his ability to explain how our better judgments can cause our continent behaviors. In this essay, I preserve Davidson's approach to the logical criterion but deviate from his broader theory of action by developing a default-interventionist dual systems theory of action. To do this, I focus on the dynamical relationship between System 1 and System 2: (1) the logical construction of value judgments in System 2 from System 1 and (2) the imaginative construction of non-propositional conative attitudes in System 1 from System 2. I draw on Street's Humean constructivism and Peacocke's theory of imagination for logical and imaginative construction, respectively. Within this framework, I provide a new definition of continence and incontinence that satisfies the logical criterion and explains how our better judgments can cause our continent behaviors.",,"[Dewey, Caleb] York Univ, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Dewey, Caleb] York Univ, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON, Canada",,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,"Ethics; Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000415724900004,

The results provided clear and consistent evidence against the glucose view of self-control such that none of the three corollaries was supported. In contrast, the effect of glucose rinsing turned out to be significant, but with alarming signs of publication bias. The implications and future directions are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies have shown that junior athletes high in self-determined motivation are less prone to experience burnout, while self-control competencies help developing athletes to be conscious and deliberate in their self-regulatory efforts toward elite sport performances and avoid negative sport participation outcomes. Combining the self-determination theory framework and psychosocial theories of self-regulation, the aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine how various types of motivation and self-control competencies together are associated with the development of burnout symptoms in junior athletes. High-level Norwegian winter-sport athletes from elite sport academies (N = 199; female n = 72; 16-20 years of age) consented to participate. Associations between six types of motivational regulation, self-control, and indices of exhaustion were investigated. We hypothesized that athletes' self-control competencies are important to operate successfully, and influenced by different types of motivation, they are expected to help athletes avoid negative sport participation outcomes such as emotional and physical exhaustion. Structural equation modeling analyses were conducted to analyze these relationships, and results revealed some multifaceted associations. When identifying antecedents of sport participation exhaustion and burnout, there is a need to go beyond the unique framework of motivation theories, and explore what cognitive competencies ensure fulfillment of motivation desires. In the current study, differences in junior athletes' quality of motivation influenced self-control competencies when predicting exhaustion. Interestingly, young athletes driven by self-determined (intrinsic, integrated, and identified), and controlled (introjected and amotivation) regulations in association with self-control offered the strongest negative and positive associations with exhaustion, respectively. Findings clearly indicate that motivation and self-control competencies are meaningfully interrelated when assessing burnout propensity in young developing athletes.",,"[Jordalen, Gro; Lemyre, Pierre-Nicolas] Noiwegian Sch Sport Sci, Dept Coaching & Psychol, Oslo, Norway; [Lemyre, Pierre-Nicolas] Noiwegian Sch Sport Sci, Noiwegian Res Ctr Training & Performance, Oslo, Norway; [Durand-Bush, Natalie] Univ Ottawa, Sch Human Kinet, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Jordalen, Gro] Noiwegian Sch Sport Sci, Dept Coaching & Psychol, Oslo, Norway",,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000388414400001,

Psychological and behavioral theories advocate the importance of both motivation and volition in interventions to change health behavior. Interventions adopting self-regulation strategies that foster motivational and volitional components may, therefore, have utility in promoting regular physical activity participation. We tested the efficacy of an intervention adopting motivational (mental simulation) and volitional (implementation intentions) components to promote a regular physical activity in two studies. Study 1 adopted a cluster randomized design in which participants (n = 92) were allocated to one of three conditions: mental simulation plus implementation intention, implementation intention only, or control. Study 2 adopted a 2 (mental simulation vs. no mental simulation) x 2 (implementation intention vs. no implementation intention) randomized controlled design in which fitness center attendees (n = 184) were randomly allocated one of four conditions: mental simulation only, implementation intention only, combined, or control. Physical activity behavior was measured by self-report (Study 1) or fitness center attendance (Study 2) at 4- (Studies 1 and 2) and 19- (Study 2 only) week follow-up periods. Findings revealed no statistically significant main or interactive effects of the mental simulation and implementation intention conditions on physical activity outcomes in either study. Findings are in contrast to previous research which has found pervasive effects for both intervention strategies. Findings are discussed in light of study limitations including the relatively small sample sizes, particularly for Study 1, deviations in the operationalization of the intervention components from previous research and the lack of a prompt for a goal intention. Future research should focus on ensuring uniformity in the format of the intervention components, test the effects of each component alone and in combination using standardized measures across multiple samples, and systematically explore effects of candidate moderators.",,"[Meslot, Carine; Allenet, Benoit; Francois, Olivier] Grenoble Alpes Univ, CNRS, UMR 5525, TIMC IMAG, Grenoble, France; [Meslot, Carine; Gauchet, Aurelie] Grenoble Alpes Univ, Lab Interuniv Psychol, Grenoble, France; [Allenet, Benoit] Grenoble Alpes Univ, Dept Pharm, Grenoble, France; [Hagger, Martin S.] Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol & Speech Pathol, Hlth Psychol & Behav Med Res Grp, Perth, WA, Australia; [Hagger, Martin S.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Sport & Hlth Sci, Dept Sport Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Hagger, Martin S.] Curtin Univ, Sch Psychol & Speech Pathol, Hlth Psychol & Behav Med Res Grp, Perth, WA, Australia; [Hagger, Martin S.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Sport & Hlth Sci, Dept Sport Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland",,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",WOS:000387800300001,

The present study tested how trait impulsivity impacts the effect of implicit preferences on food consumption in a depleted condition. Trait impulsivity was measured by means of self-report and a stop signal task. Results showed that both self-reported impulsivity and behavioral impulsivity moderated the 'depletion and then eating according to implicit preferences' effect, albeit in different ways. Participants high in self-reported impulsivity and low in behavioral impulsivity were more vulnerable to the effect of depletion on eating.

They found that the probability of a favorable decision drops from about 65% to almost 0% from the first ruling to the last ruling within each session and that the rate of favorable rulings returns to 65% in a session following a food break. The authors argue that these findings provide support for extraneous factors influencing judicial decisions and cautiously speculate that the effect might be driven by mental depletion. A simulation shows that the observed influence of order can be alternatively explained by a statistical artifact resulting from favorable rulings taking longer than unfavorable ones. An effect of similar magnitude would be produced by a (hypothetical) rational judge who plans ahead minimally and ends a session instead of starting cases that he or she assumes will take longer directly before the break. One methodological detail further increased the magnitude of the artifact and generates it even without assuming any foresight concerning the upcoming case.

Experimental research highlights that a drinker's level of self-control impacts the aggression inducing effects of alcohol, however, assessments used to measure this type of aggression are limited. Extant investigations utilize trait self-control only, neglecting the influence of state self-regulation. Daily variation in self-regulatory demands has been found to inhibit impulse control, however, methodological techniques to assess self-regulation variation have not been applied to help explain alcohol-related aggression. The current paper argues for a conceptual model of alcohol-related aggression that integrates both trait and state levels of regulatory control. The proposed cohesive model is suggested to help explain alcohol consumption, aggressive behavior, and alcohol-related aggression.

In contrast, the reflective-impulsive model predicts that ego depletion results in behaviour that is more consistent with desires, and less consistent with motivations, rather than influencing the strength of desires and motivations. The current study sought to test these alternative accounts of the relationships between ego depletion, motivation, desire, and self-control. MethodsOne hundred and fifty-six undergraduate women were randomised to complete a depleting e-crossing task or a non-depleting task, followed by a lab-based measure of snack intake, and self-report measures of motivation and desire strength. Results and ConclusionsIn partial support of the process model, ego depletion was related to higher intake, but only indirectly via the influence of lowered motivation. Motivation was more strongly predictive of intake for those in the non-depletion condition, providing partial support for the reflective-impulsive model. Ego depletion did not affect desire, nor did depletion moderate the effect of desire on intake, indicating that desire may be an appropriate target for reducing unhealthy behaviour across situations where self-control resources vary.",,"[Haynes, Ashleigh; Kemps, Eva] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Psychol, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Moffitt, Robyn] Griffith Univ, Sch Appl Psychol, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Moffitt, Robyn] Menzies Hlth Inst, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Haynes, Ashleigh] Univ Liverpool, Psychol Sci, Eleanor Rathbone Bldg, Liverpool L69 7ZA, Merseyside, England",,,,,,,,9,,,,,,,"Psychology, Applied",WOS:000387122800006,

All subjects responded to four trolley type dilemmas and four dictator games involving different charitable causes. Decisions were made under time pressure/time delay or while experiencing cognitive load or control. Overall we find converging evidence that intuitive states do not influence moral decisions. Neither time-pressure nor cognitive load had any effect on moral judgments or altruistic behavior. Thus we find no supporting evidence for the claim that intuitive moral judgments and dictator game giving differ from more reflectively taken decisions. Across all samples and decision tasks men were more likely to make utilitarian moral judgments and act selfishly compared to women, providing further evidence that there are robust gender differences in moral decision-making.

This review discusses some details of this process for prominent findings about racial bias, where a set of studies seems ""too good to be true."" This kind of analysis is based on the original studies, so it avoids criticism from the original authors about the validity of replication studies. The analysis is also much easier to perform than a new empirical study. A variation of the analysis can also be used to explore whether it makes sense to run a replication study.
