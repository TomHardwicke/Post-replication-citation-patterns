This study examined 2013 9-10 year olds in the first data release from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development 21-site consortium study in order to identify resting state functional connectivity patterns that predict individual-differences in three domains of higher-order cognitive functions: General Ability, Speed/Flexibility, and Learning/Memory. For General Ability scores in particular, we observed consistent cross-site generalizability, with statistically significant predictions in 14 out of 15 held-out sites. These results survived several tests for robustness including replication in split-half analysis and in a low head motion subsample. We additionally found that connectivity patterns involving task control networks and default mode network were prominently implicated in predicting differences in General Ability across participants. These findings demonstrate that resting state connectivity can be leveraged to produce generalizable markers of neurocognitive functioning. Additionally, they highlight the importance of task control-default mode network interconnections as a major locus of individual differences in cognitive functioning in early adolescence.","[Sripada, Chandra; Rutherford, Saige; Angstadt, Mike; Weigard, Alexander; Heitzeg, Mary] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Thompson, Wesley K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biostat, Dept Family Med & Publ Hlth, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Luciana, Monica] Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Hyde, Luke H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Inst Social Res, Ctr Human Growth & Dev, Ann Arbor, MI USA","Sripada, C (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sripada@umich.edu,"; Angstadt, Mike/K-2942-2016","Heitzeg, Mary/0000-0002-6737-2971; Rutherford, Saige/0000-0003-3006-9044; Sripada, Chandra/0000-0001-9025-6453; Angstadt, Mike/0000-0003-4870-7649; Hyde, Luke/0000-0002-5947-7896","NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [T32 AA007477] Funding Source: Medline; NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [U01 DA041048, U24 DA041147, U01 DA041093, U24 DA041123, U01 DA041028, U01 DA041025, U01 DA041156, U01 DA041089, U01 DA041106, U01 DA041117, U01 DA041148, U01 DA041174, U01 DA041120, U01 DA041134, U01 DA041022] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH107741] Funding Source: Medline",NA,NA,59,8,8,0,1,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1359-4184,1476-5578,NA,MOL PSYCHIATR,Mol.

In this study, we used a verbalized thought protocol to investigate clump-and-jump structure in SST-clusters of related thoughts about a topic followed by a jump to a new topic, in a repeating pattern. Several lines of evidence convergently supported the presence of clump-and-jump structure: high interrater agreement in identifying jumps, corroboration of rater-assigned jumps by automated text analytic methods, identification of clumps and jumps by a data-driven algorithm, and the inferred presence of clumps and jumps in unverbalized SST. We also found evidence that jumps involve a discontinuous shift in which a new clump is only modestly related to the previous one.

Four prominent views define mind-wandering as (a) task-unrelated thought, (b) stimulus-independent thought, (c) unintentional thought, or (d) dynamically unguided thought. Although theorists claim to capture the ordinary understanding of mind-wandering, no systematic studies have assessed these claims. Two large factorial studies present participants (N = 545) with vignettes that describe someone's thoughts and ask whether her mind was wandering, while systematically manipulating features relevant to the four major accounts of mind-wandering. Dynamics explains between four and 40 times more variance in participants' mind-wandering judgments than other features. Our third study (N = 153) tests and supports a unique prediction of the dynamic framework-obsessive rumination contrasts with mind-wandering. Our final study (N = 277) used vignettes that resemble mind-wandering experiments. Dynamics had significant and large effects, while task-unrelatedness was nonsignificant. These results strongly suggest that the central feature of mind-wandering is its dynamics.","[Irving, Zachary C.; Glasser, Aaron] Univ Virginia, Corcoran Dept Philosophy, 102 Cocke Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Gopnik, Alison; Pinter, Verity] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, 3210 Tolman Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sripada, Chandra] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sripada, Chandra] Univ Michigan, Dept Philosophy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Irving, ZC (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Corcoran Dept Philosophy, 102 Cocke Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",zci7c@virginia.edu,NA,"Irving, Zachary/0000-0002-6621-5202; Gopnik, Alison/0000-0002-7183-0867; Sripada, Chandra/0000-0001-9025-6453",John Templeton Foundation: The Science & Philosophy of Self Control (49684) and Summer Seminars in Neuroscience and Philosophy (48365) Funding Source: Medline; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Postdoctoral Fellowship (756-2015-0715) Funding Source: Medline,NA,NA,44,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0364-0213,1551-6709,NA,COGNITIVE SCI,Cogn.

Identifying brain-based markers of GCA has been a longstanding goal of cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Recently, predictive modeling methods have emerged that build whole-brain, distributed neural signatures for phenotypes of interest. In this study, we employ a predictive modeling approach to predict GCA based on fMRI task activation patterns during the N-back working memory task as well as six other tasks in the Human Connectome Project dataset (n = 967), encompassing 15 task contrasts in total. We found tasks are a highly effective basis for prediction of GCA: The 2-back versus 0-back contrast achieved a 0.50 correlation with GCA scores in 10-fold cross-validation, and 13 out of 15 task contrasts afforded statistically significant prediction of GCA. Additionally, we found that task contrasts that produce greater frontoparietal activation and default mode network deactivation-a brain activation pattern associated with executive processing and higher cognitive demand-are more effective in the prediction of GCA. These results suggest a picture analogous to treadmill testing for cardiac function: Placing the brain in a more cognitively demanding task state significantly improves brain-based prediction of GCA.","[Sripada, Chandra; Angstadt, Mike; Rutherford, Saige; Taxali, Aman] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Shedden, Kerby] Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Sripada, C (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sripada@umich.edu,"Rutherford, Saige/ABD-9680-2020","Sripada, Chandra/0000-0001-9025-6453; Rutherford, Saige/0000-0003-3006-9044",Dana Foundation David Mahoney Neuroimaging Program; National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH107741],"Dana Foundation David Mahoney Neuroimaging Program; National Institute of Mental Health, Grant/Award Number: R01MH107741",NA,80,2,2,3,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1065-9471,1097-0193,NA,HUM BRAIN MAPP,Hum.

However, clinical neuroimaging studies using this task have yielded conflicting results, raising basic questions about what the task measures and which aspects of the task relate to clinical outcomes. We used computational modeling to provide a clearer understanding of how neural activations from this task relate to the cognitive mechanisms that underlie performance and to probe the implications of these relationships for clinical research. METHODS: A total of 143 young adults (8-21 years of age) performed the go/no-go task during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. We used the diffusion decision model (DDM), a cognitive modeling approach, to quantify distinct neurocognitive processes that underlie go/no-go performance. We then assessed correlations between DDM parameters and brain activation from standard go/no-go contrasts and assessed relationships of DDM parameters and associated neural measures with clinical ratings. RESULTS: Right-lateralized prefrontal activations on correct inhibition trials, which are generally assumed to isolate neural processes involved in inhibition, were unrelated to DDM parameters (and other performance indices). However, responses to failed inhibitions in brain regions associated with error monitoring were strongly related to more efficient task performance and correlated with externalizing behavior and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings cast doubt on conventional interpretations of go/no-go task-related activations as reflecting the neural basis of inhibitory functioning. We instead found evidence that error-related contrasts provide clinically relevant information about neural systems involved in monitoring and optimizing the efficiency of cognitive performance.","[Weigard, Alexander; Soules, Mary; Ferris, Bailey; Zucker, Robert A.; Sripada, Chandra; Heitzeg, Mary] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Rachel Upjohn Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Weigard, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Rachel Upjohn Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",asweigar@med.umich.edu,NA,"Sripada, Chandra/0000-0001-9025-6453; Ferris, Bailey/0000-0003-0135-2908; Heitzeg, Mary/0000-0002-6737-2971","National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01 AA07065, R01 AA025790]; NIAAAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [T32 AA007477]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA025790, R01AA025790, R01AA025790] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This project was supported by National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) Grant Nos.

In domains where networks are discovered on multiple time series, the most common approach is to compute measures of association or similarity between all pairs of time series. The nodes in the resultant network correspond to time series, which are linked by edges weighted according to the association scores of their endpoints. Finally, the fully connected network is thresholded such that only the edges with stronger weights remain and the desired sparsity level is achieved. While this approach is feasible for small datasets, its quadratic (or higher) time complexity does not scale as the individual time series length and the number of compared series increase. Thus, to circumvent the inefficient and wasteful intermediary step of building a fully connected graph before network sparsification, we propose a fast network discovery approach based on probabilistic hashing. Our methods emphasize consecutiveness, or the intuition that time series following similar fluctuations in longer time-consecutive intervals are more similar overall. Evaluation on real data shows that our method can build graphs nearly 15 times faster than baselines (when the baselines do not run out of memory), while achieving accuracy comparable to, or better than, baselines in task-based evaluation. Furthermore, our proposals are general, modular, and may be applied to a variety of sequence similarity search tasks.","[Safavi, Tara; Koutra, Danai] Univ Michigan, Comp Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sripada, Chandra] Univ Michigan, Psychiat & Philosophy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Safavi, T (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Comp Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tsafavi@umich.edu,NA,NA,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IIS 1743088]; Trove.

It is an open question, however, whether connectomes differ across individuals in a correspondingly massive number of ways, or whether most differences take a small number of characteristic forms. We systematically investigated this question and found clear evidence of low-rank structure in which a modest number of connectomic components, around 50-150, account for a sizable portion of inter-individual connectomic variation. This number was convergently arrived at with multiple methods including estimation of intrinsic dimensionality and assessment of reconstruction of out-of-sample data. In addition, we show that these connectomic components enable prediction of a broad array of neurocognitive and clinical symptom variables at levels comparable to a leading method that is trained on the whole connectome. Qualitative observation reveals that these connectomic components exhibit extensive community structure reflecting interrelationships between intrinsic connectivity networks. We provide quantitative validation of this observation using novel stochastic block model-based methods. We propose that these connectivity components form an effective basis set for quantifying and interpreting inter-individual connectomic differences, and for predicting behavioral/clinical phenotypes.","[Sripada, Chandra; Angstadt, Mike; Rutherford, Saige; Kessler, Daniel; Yee, Mike] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kessler, Daniel; Kim, Yura; Levina, Elizaveta] Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Sripada, C (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sripada@umich.edu,"Angstadt, Mike/K-2942-2016; Rutherford, Saige/ABD-9680-2020; Kessler, Daniel/B-8512-2013","Angstadt, Mike/0000-0003-4870-7649; Rutherford, Saige/0000-0003-3006-9044; Yee, Michael/0000-0003-3688-5202; Kessler, Daniel/0000-0003-2052-025X; Sripada, Chandra/0000-0001-9025-6453","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1521551]; N.S.F. grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1646108]; Dana Foundation David Mahoney Neuroimaging Program;  [R01MH107741];  [U01DA041106]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH107741, R01MH107741] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [U01DA041106, U01DA041106, U01DA041106, U01DA041106, U01DA041106] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",C.S. was supported by R01MH107741 and U01DA041106.

To unite these modalities in a common model, we used joint independent component analysis, a multivariate, multimodal method that identifies cohesive components that span modalities. Based on recent network models of ADHD, we hypothesized that altered relationships between large-scale networks, in particular, default mode network (DMN) and task-positive networks (TPNs), would co-occur with structural abnormalities in cognitive regulation regions. For 756 human participants in the ADHD-200 sample, we produced gray and white matter volume maps with voxel-based morphometry, as well as whole-brain functional connectomes. Joint independent component analysis was performed, and the resulting transmodal components were tested for differential expression in ADHD versus healthy controls. Four components showed greater expression in ADHD. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, we observed reduced DMN-TPN segregation co-occurring with structural abnormalities in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, two important cognitive control regions. We also observed altered intranetwork connectivity in DMN, dorsal attention network, and visual network, with co-occurring distributed structural deficits. There was strong evidence of spatial correspondence across modalities: For all four components, the impact of the respective component on gray matter at a region strongly predicted the impact on functional connectivity at that region. Overall, our results demonstrate that ADHD involves multiple, cohesive modality spanning deficits, each one of which exhibits strong spatial overlap in the pattern of structural and functional alterations.","[Kessler, Daniel; Angstadt, Michael; Welsh, Robert C.; Sripada, Chandra] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Welsh, Robert C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Radiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Sripada, C (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Rachel Upjohn Bldg,Room 2743,4250 Plymouth Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sripada@umich.edu,"Angstadt, Mike/K-2942-2016; Kessler, Daniel/B-8512-2013","Angstadt, Mike/0000-0003-4870-7649; Kessler, Daniel/0000-0003-2052-025X","National Institutes of Health GrantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AA020297]; Center for Computational Medicine Pilot Grant; John Templeton Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [K23AA020297, K23AA020297, K23AA020297, K23AA020297, K23AA020297] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","C.S. was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant AA020297, Center for Computational Medicine Pilot Grant, and the John Templeton Foundation.",NA,76,40,40,0,26,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0270-6474,1529-2401,NA,J NEUROSCI,J.

Neuroimaging investigations of ADHD have traditionally sought to detect localized abnormalities in discrete brain regions. Recent years, however, have seen the emergence of complementary lines of investigation into distributed connectivity disturbances in ADHD. Current models emphasize abnormal relationships between default network-involved in internally directed mentation and lapses of attention-and task positive networks, especially ventral attention network. However, studies that comprehensively investigate interrelationships between large-scale networks in ADHD remain relatively rare. Methods: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 757 participants at seven sites in the ADHD-200 multisite sample. Functional connectomes were generated for each subject, and interrelationships between seven large-scale brain networks were examined with network contingency analysis. Results: ADHD brains exhibited altered resting state connectivity between default network and ventral attention network [P < 0.0001, false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected], including prominent increased connectivity (more specifically, diminished anticorrelation) between posterior cingulate cortex in default network and right anterior insula and supplementary motor area in ventral attention network. There was distributed hypoconnectivity within default network (P = 0.009, FDR-corrected), and this network also exhibited significant alterations in its interconnections with several other large-scale networks. Additionally, there was pronounced right lateralization of aberrant default network connections. Conclusions: Consistent with existing theoretical models, these results provide evidence that default network-ventral attention network interconnections are a key locus of dysfunction in ADHD. Moreover, these findings contribute to growing evidence that distributed dysconnectivity within and between large-scale networks is present in ADHD.
