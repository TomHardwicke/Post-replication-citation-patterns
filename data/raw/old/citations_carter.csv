It is crucial to recognize the barriers, whether cognitive or emotional, that influence individuals' willingness to sign up onto organ donation registries. In the current investigation, we hypothesize that a politically-conservative ideology reduces peoples organ donation intentions. This is likely since individuals with a conservative ideology care more about the integrity of the human body, are more disgusted by the very act of organ donations, and believe that signing onto such registries would be tempting fate. We test and confirm this possibility in a study with 148 Australians. The findings indicate that political ideology can be a predictor of individuals' likelihood of becoming organ donors.","[Chan, Eugene Y.] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, 26 Sir John Monash Dr, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia","Chan, EY (reprint author), Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, 26 Sir John Monash Dr, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",Eugene.Chan@monash.edu,,,,,,42,0,0,0,0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0191-8869,,,PERS INDIV DIFFER,Pers.

Drawing broadly on Social Identity Theory, we predict that exposure to one's national flag can reduce tax evasion by making salient one's national identity, motivating one to sacrifice one's self-interests for one's country-which would presumably include paying one's fair share of taxes. In three experiments, we found that exposure to American, Australian, and British flags reduced Americans', Australians', and Britons' tax evasion in financially incentivized tasks (Experiments 1, 3) and increased tax-paying attitudes (Experiment 2). The effects arose because flag primes made salient participants' national identities that then motivated them to help their country. We ruled out social norms and trust in authorities as alternative explanations. As such, flag primes might reduce tax evasion and in doing so improve the economic and societal welfare of a country.","[Chan, Eugene Y.] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, 26 Sir John Monash Dr, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia","Chan, EY (reprint author), Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, 26 Sir John Monash Dr, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",Eugene.Chan@monash.edu,"Chan, Eugene/D-9088-2014","Chan, Eugene/0000-0002-6847-6545",,,,92,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-2772,1099-0992,,EUR J SOC PSYCHOL,Eur.

Yet, we know little about the psychological associations of mobile phones. It has been proposed that due to their role in maintaining social relationships, the mobile phone, as an object, has become the representation of a person's social network. This paper empirically investigates this idea. A sample of 154 university students participated in an experiment that tested the cognitive consequences of activating the concept of a mobile phone. We primed the concept of a mobile phone and measured the accessibility of thoughts related to social relationships with a word fragment completion task. People reminded of their mobile phones (vs. neutral personal objects) found significantly more words related to social networks, demonstrating the association between social relationships and the idea of mobile phones. Additionally, priming people with their mobile phones was associated with lower need to belong.","[Kardos, Peter] Bloomfield Coll, Bloomfield, NJ 07003 USA; [Unoka, Zsolt] Semmelweis Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Pleh, Csaba] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Soltesz, Peter] Pazmany Peter Catholic Univ, Budapest, Hungary","Kardos, P (reprint author), Bloomfield Coll, Div Social & Behav Sci, 59 Fremont St, Bloomfield, NJ 07003 USA.",peter_kardos@bloomfield.edu,,, [TAMOP-4.2.2.C-11/1/KONV-2012-0008],This research was supported by TAMOP-4.2.2.C-11/1/KONV-2012-0008.,,55,1,1,18,24,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0747-5632,1873-7692,,COMPUT HUM BEHAV,Comput.

We explore a third possibility - that it may actually polarize Americans' political ideology. It is generally accepted that exposure to an environmental cue can shift attitudes and behaviours, at least partly or temporarily, in a manner that is consistent with that cue. Yet, the same cue can mean different things to different people. In the same vein, given how national identity and political ideology are intertwined in the United States, we hypothesize that the American flag should heighten different political beliefs depending on individuals' political ideology. To Democrats, being American is to support Democratic values, but to Republicans, being American is to support Republican values. The American flag thus should heighten Democrats of their Democratic identity, and it should heighten Republicans of their Republican one. The results of an experiment with 752 American respondents who were representative of the US population supported this polarizing effect of the American flag. The theoretical and policy implications of the findings are offered.","[Chan, Eugene Y.] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, 26 Sir John Monash Dr, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia","Chan, EY (reprint author), Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, 26 Sir John Monash Dr, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",Eugene.Chan@monash.edu,"Chan, Eugene/D-9088-2014","Chan, Eugene/0000-0002-6847-6545",,,,36,1,1,4,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0144-6665,2044-8309,,BRIT J SOC PSYCHOL,Br.

The present research examines (1) whether the presence of the American flag on a product affects consumers' evaluation of products and (2) the social cognitive mechanisms underlying the effect of the flag on product-related judgments. This research provides evidence that the presence of the American flag on a product induces negative product evaluation (Study 1). This negative effect is found to be moderated by participants' trait level of psychological reactance (Study 2) and mediated by participants' outrage (Study 3a) and perceived persuasion (Study 3b).

Inaddition, not enough attention was paid to the strategies used by participants, and there was alack of theories implemented as computer models offering sufficient precision for being tested rigorously. He proposed a three-headed research program: to develop computational models ableto carry out the task they aimed to explain; to study one complex task in detail, such as chess; and to build computational models that can account for multiple tasks. This article assesses the extent to which the papers in this issue advance Newell's program. While half of the papers devote much attention to strategies, several papers still average across them, a capital sin according to Newell. The three courses of action he proposed were not popular in these papers: Only two papers used computational models, with no model being both able to carry out the task and to account for human data; there was no systematic analysis of a specific video game; and no paper proposed a computational model accounting for human data in several tasks. It is concluded that, while they use sophisticated methods of analysis and discuss interesting results, overall these papers contribute only little to Newell's program of research. In this respect, they reflect the current state of psychology and cognitive science. This is a shame, as Newell's ideas might help address the current crisis of lack of replication and fraud in psychology.","[Gobet, Fernand] Univ Liverpool, Dept Psychol Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZA, Merseyside, England","Gobet, F (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Psychol Sci, Liverpool L69 7ZA, Merseyside, England.",fernand.gobet@liverpool.ac.uk,,,,,,47,1,1,1,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1756-8757,1756-8765,,TOP COGN SCI,Top.

Either photographs of urban greenery, conifer forests, or shopping malls were presented or no prime was employed. Three experiments were conducted (N = 126, N = 88, and N = 121). After being exposed to the priming or no-priming conditions, the participants were asked to walk along an urban route 1.9 km long with vegetation and mature trees (Experiment 1, Experiment 3) or along a route in a modern suburb (Experiment 2). In accord with the concept of approach-avoidance behavior, it was expected that priming with photographs congruent with the environmental setting of the walking route would result in slower walking speed. Conversely, priming with photographs incongruent with the environmental setting should result in faster walking speed. The results showed that priming with the photographs with vegetation caused a decrease in overall walking speed on the route relative to other experimental conditions. However, priming with incongruent primes did not lead to a significant increase in walking speed.

This is problematic because images are a key method by which news is selected, framed and communicated, particularly in tabloid newspapers. This article focuses upon criticisms that tabloids from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation Australia were biasedagainst the Kevin Rudd-led Labor government and towards Tony Abbott's conservative Liberal-National Coalitionduring the 2013 federal election in Australia. Through an analysis of front pages, this article explores how photographs contributed to reporting the campaign and expressing the strong political preferences of News Corporation. The article concludes that Murdoch's Australian tabloids shifted towards a British-style overt partisanship in their reporting of the 2013 election. Images were at the forefront of that shift as they are a powerful tool for conveying messages of newspaper support and opposition, and occupy a central place in how political issues, events and individuals are represented and understood.","[Young, Sally] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Young, S (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",s.young@unimelb.edu.au,,"Young, Sally/0000-0002-4030-4012",,,,74,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Metaphoric media frames (e.g., the presidential campaign is a horserace) can prime or highlight specific aspects of a political event (e.g., candidate electability) and thereby influence the public's attitudes and opinion (e.g., attitudes toward a political candidate).

I discuss a contemporary interpretation of this thesis in terms of frequentist statistics in the context of the behavioral sciences. First, I identify experimental replications and systematic aggregation of evidence (meta-analysis) as the self-corrective mechanism. Then, I present a computer simulation study of scientific communities that implement this mechanism to argue that frequentist statistics may converge upon a correct estimate or not depending on the social structure of the community that uses it. Based on this study, I argue that methodological explanations of the ""replicability crisis"" in psychology are limited and propose an alternative explanation in terms of biases.

But the flag's benefits may be more elusive than they appear. We begin by presenting content analysis of the flag's prevalence in 2012 U.S. presidential campaign ads, which suggests both candidates saw flags as advantageous. Then, in two experiments set during the 2012 campaign and a later study with prospective 2016 candidates, we find flag exposure provides modest but consistent benefits for Republican candidates among voters high in symbolic patriotism, racial prejudice, and Republican identification. These effects arise regardless of which candidate appears with the flag. Taken together, our results speak to both the power and limitations of the American flag in electioneering. Beyond practical implications for campaigns, these studies emphasize the heterogeneity of citizens' reactions to visual political symbols and highlight potent links between symbolic attitudes and a nation's flag.","[Kalmoe, Nathan P.] Monmouth Coll, Monmouth, IL USA; [Gross, Kimberly] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA","Kalmoe, NP (reprint author), Monmouth Coll, Dept Polit Sci, 700 E Broadway, Monmouth, IL 61462 USA.",nkalmoe@monmouthcollege.edu,,,,,,44,6,6,3,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0162-895X,1467-9221,,POLIT PSYCHOL,Polit.

Austerity, the Eurozone crisis, rising immigration and heightened fear of terrorism all present serious challenges to the process of integration. How does this context of insecurity impact on what the EU means to its citizens? Will the public become increasingly Eurosceptic or will they discover a hitherto unrecognised attachment to the EU as the prospect of its collapse becomes real? Psychological research has demonstrated that individual exposure to threat decreases cognitive capacity, inducing a tendency towards rigidity or conservatism - a tendency to cling to the 'devil you know'. So what might this mean for the European integration process? Using experimental techniques drawn from political psychology, the authors find a dual threat effect. The EU symbol has a negative (anti-EU) effect on EU-related attitudes when presented in neutral context. This is consonant with conceptualisations of the EU as a threat to national cultural and political norms. In contrast, however, visual priming of participants with EU symbols has a positive (pro-EU) effect on related attitudes when symbols are presented in a context that implies a subtle but imminent threat to the benefits of EU membership.","[Patrikios, Stratos] Sch Govt & Publ Policy, McCance Bldg,16 Richmond St, Glasgow G11 XQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Cram, Laura] Sch Social & Polit Sci Polit & Int Relat, Chrystal Macmillan Bldg,15a George St, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland","Patrikios, S (reprint author), Sch Govt & Publ Policy, McCance Bldg,16 Richmond St, Glasgow G11 XQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,"Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L003139/1, ES/I021744/1]",,,49,1,1,4,24,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1472-4790,1740-388X,,COMP EUR POLIT,Comp.

In two studies, we draw from a framework of anchoring and adjustment to understand why liberals and conservatives differ in their perceptions of ingroup similarity. Results indicate that when participants made judgments under time pressure, liberals and conservatives did not differ in assuming ingroup similarity. However, when participants were given sufficient time to make judgments, liberals assumed less similarity than conservatives did, suggesting that liberals adjusted their judgments to a greater extent than conservatives did (Studies 1 and 2). In examining an underlying motivational process, we found that when conservatives' desire to affiliate with others was attenuated, they adjusted their initial judgments of ingroup similarity to a similar extent as liberals did (Study 2).

Ioannidis claim is valid only for one-shot studies without replication and with a low a priori probability that the tested hypothesis is true. Mass replication provides limited information about the validity of social psychological research, because failures to replicate do not prove that the original finding is invalid.

Some research says that abstraction polarizes political attitudes by making liberals more liberal and conservatives more conservative. Other research instead argues that an abstract construal causes people to exhibit similar political attitudes as each other. The current research presents two experiments in which abstraction polarizes political attitudes on issues of social inequality. However, abstraction also increases traditionalism, and so it increases a preference for maintaining the societal status quo, such as by increasing one's disagreement with or opposition to homosexuality. The dual impacts of abstraction parallel the two distinct dimensions of political ideology (i.e., acceptance of social inequality and preference for the status quo), both of which prior research on construal level has not yet considered. Overall, the current findings indicate that the effects of construal level and the dimensions underlying political ideology need to be teased apart to fully understand the exact relationship between the two.","[Chan, Eugene Y.] Univ Technol Sydney, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Chan, EY (reprint author), Univ Technol Sydney, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",eugene.chan@uts.edu.au,"Chan, Eugene/D-9088-2014","Chan, Eugene/0000-0002-6847-6545",,,,35,0,0,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-2772,1099-0992,,EUR J SOC PSYCHOL,Eur.

We find that photographs increased ethnic voting, and our evidence indicates a priming effect, while ruling out learning as a likely alternate explanation.

In line with previous research, we find evidence that White voters stereotype Black candidates as being more liberal than White candidates in three of our four tests. In contrast, we find that Black votersparticularly those who identify as politically conservativeproject their own ideology onto Black candidates. These findings have electoral importance because, as we show, vote choice for both Blacks and Whites is substantially mediated by perceived ideological distance from a candidate.

We used the association between the concrete (spatial) and abstract (ideological) components of the political left-right metaphor to demonstrate that metaphorical conflict has marked implications for cognitive processing and social perception. Specifically, we showed that creating conflict between a spatial location and a metaphorically linked concept reduces perceived differences between the attitudes of partisans who are generally viewed as possessing fundamentally different worldviews (Democrats and Republicans). We further demonstrated that metaphorical conflict reduces perceived attitude differences by creating a mind-set in which categories are represented as possessing broader boundaries than when concepts are metaphorically compatible. These results suggest that metaphorical conflict shapes social perception by making members of distinct groups appear more similar than they are generally thought to be.

But are negative stereotypes of the public sector reflected in people's perceptions of public service provision? Given the methodological challenges of isolating the perception of publicness from other factors related to public organizations, little is known about whether public organizations have a negative image. The authors use a survey experimental design to isolate the effect of publicness on perceptions of the performance of hospitals. The results suggest that public sector organizations have a negative image on productivity-related aspects of performance but not on normative aspects of performance. As this article is a randomized experiment, it provides strong evidence regarding the causal nature of the relationship between publicness and perceptions of performance. Implications for researchers aiming to understand these mechanisms and for public managers concerned about the image of their organization are discussed.","[Hvidman, Ulrik; Andersen, Simon Calmar] Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Hvidman, U (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",uhvidman@ps.au.dk; sca@ps.au.dk,,,,,,51,9,9,5,34,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0033-3352,1540-6210,,PUBLIC ADMIN REV,Public Adm.

Apparently, it is assumed that the deliberate and intentional decision of voters can be swayed at the last minute, thereby compromising free and fair elections. While traditional approaches to electoral behaviour typically fail to recognise such influences, evidence from behavioural psychology suggests that subtle primes can indeed automatically trigger individual action. This paper therefore argues that voting, too, is subject to unsuspected primes. In particular, we analyse whether the innocuous environmental setting of the polling place can influence vote choice. Whether priming effects extend to political behaviour presents a puzzle that is yet not sufficiently investigated. On the one hand, two recent studies do show such behavioural priming effects for the USA. On the other hand, however, there is a serious debate about behavioural priming in general questioning the replicability of earlier studies. Against this background, our paper presents the first replication outside the USA of previous findings, and furthermore extends behavioural priming to other instances. Specifically, we address three questions. First, can behavioural priming of vote choice be replicated or are findings specific to the context of the USA? Second, does behavioural priming of vote choice also occur in elections in multi-party systems? And third, how do ambiguous primes affect decisions in votes, in which the prime does not correspond directly to favouring one choice over another? Using precinct level data from two federal city-states of Germany, Hamburg and Berlin, we find that results of popular votes and elections do, in fact, differ depending on the polling place being situated in a school. Our findings are not only relevant to the theoretical conception of vote choice and contribute to psychological accounts of political behaviour, but they also have practical implications for the design of electoral institutions.

This has led some philosophers to be skeptical of responsible agency or personhood in the moral sense. I present two arguments defending agency from these skeptical concerns. My first argument, the ""margin of error"" argument, is that the empirical evidence is consistent with the possibility that our automatic behavior deviates only slightly from what we would do if we were in full conscious control. Responsible agency requires only that our actions more or less express our conscious goals and values. My second argument is a non-realist defense of moral agency. If we are willing to reject metaethical realism about agents, then there may be good reasons why we should retain the concept of agency in our moralizing, even if automaticity undermines the belief that we are really in conscious control of our behavior. We can do this by adopting a ""reactive attitudes"" approach to moral responsibility. On this view, agency is determined not by actual features of human psychology but by the attitudes and practices (such as praise and blame) that we ought to adopt in response to the actions and motivations of individuals.","Univ So Mississippi, Dept Philosophy & Relig, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA","Meyers, CD (reprint author), Univ So Mississippi, Dept Philosophy & Relig, 118 Coll Dr 5015, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.",cd.meyers@usm.edu,,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0353-5150,1874-6349,,ACTA ANAL,Acta Anal.-Int.

In our commentary, we argue that the author presents an overly idealized review of the literature in support of the YIC principle. Furthermore, we point out that the dissimilar trends observed in social and cognitive psychology, with respect to published evidence of strong unconscious effects, can better be explained by the way how awareness is defined and measured in both research fields. Finally, we show that the experimental paradigm chosen by Hassin to rule out remaining objections against the YIC principle is unsuited to verify the new default notion that all high-level cognitive functions can unfold unconsciously.","[Hesselmann, Guido] Charite, Visual Percept Lab, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Moors, Pieter] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Lab Expt Psychol, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium","Hesselmann, G (reprint author), Charite, Visual Percept Lab, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Campus Charite Mitte,Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",guido.hesselmann@charite.de; pieter.moors@ppw.kuleuven.be,"Hesselmann, Guido/I-2880-2016","Hesselmann, Guido/0000-0002-8873-7212; Moors, Pieter/0000-0002-4667-1235",German Research Foundation [HE 6244/1-1]; Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO),GH was supported by the German Research Foundation (grant HE 6244/1-1).

Using two different measures of political extremity, we found that extremists were less influenced than political moderates by two types of experimenter-generated anchors (Studies 1-3) and that this result was mediated by extremists' belief superiority (Study 2). Extremists and moderates, however, were not differentially influenced by self-generated anchors (Study 2), which suggests that extremists differentiated between externally and internally generated anchors. These results are consistent with the confident-extremist perspective and contradict the unthinking-extremist perspective.

A question therefore arises over how such change impacts law's treatment of scientific evidence. The present standard for the admissibility of scientific evidence in federal courts in the U.S. asks judges to play the role of gatekeeper, determining if the proffered evidence conforms with several indicia of scientific validity. The replicability crisis, however, has demonstrated that these indicia frequently fail to adequately capture, or have lagged behind, science's best practices. Therefore, this article suggests that as much as the replicability crisis highlights serious issues in the scientific process, it should have similar implications and actionable consequences for legal practitioners and academics. The Article concludes with some suggestions to help ensure that legal decisions are influenced by the best science has to offer.","Univ Toronto, Fac Law, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada","Chin, JM (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Fac Law, 84 Queens Pk, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",jason.chin@mail.utoronto.ca,,"Chin, Jason/0000-0002-6573-2670",,,,96,7,8,0,13,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1076-8971,1939-1528,,PSYCHOL PUBLIC POL L,Psychol.

On one hand, affirming people's sense of power might give them confidence to think beyond the densest subsections of their social networks. Alternatively, if such power affirmations conflict with people's more stable status characteristics, this could create tension, deterring people from considering their networks' diversity. We test these competing hypotheses experimentally by priming people at varying levels of status with power (high/low) and asking them to report their social networks. We show that confirming identity-not affirming power-cognitively prepares people to broaden their social networks when the world is changing around them. The emotional signature of having a confirmed identity is feeling comfortable and in control, which mediates network activation. We suggest that stable, confirmed identities are the foundation from which people can exhibit greater network responsiveness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This article reports the results of two experiments that test our affective contagion hypothesis-unnoticed affective cues influence the retrieval and construction of conscious considerations in the direction of affective congruence. We then test whether these affectively congruent considerations influence subsequently reported policy evaluations, which we call affective mediation. In short, the considerations that come consciously to mind to inform and to support the attitude construction process are biased systematically by the feelings that are aroused in the earliest stages of processing.

However, whether national identity alters differences in links between political affiliation and evaluations of immigrants is not well articulated, and this includes a potential for national identity to either bolster or lessen harshness toward immigrant job-seekers. Moreover, research has yet to identify psychological mechanisms that could transmit a conjoint effect of political affiliation and national identity. In this study, we examined the capacity of national identity to accentuate links between political affiliation and perceived employability of immigrants. Liberal and conservative employment experts (human resource professionals and managers) were experimentally primed to elicit either a personal or national (U.S.) identity, and measures of attitudes toward immigrant job-seekers were collected. Results suggested a polarizing effect of national identity: conservative employers viewed immigrants as less employable when primed with national identity, while liberal employers rated immigrants as more employable. Among conservatives, priming national identity also resulted in greater collective self-esteem - feelings of self-worth derived from group membership. Moreover, increases in collective self-esteem mediated the link between primed national identity and less perceived employability among conservatives. Overall, this research contributes to emerging literature by suggesting that the capacity of national identity to either bolster or lessen harshness toward immigrants may depend on political affiliation. In addition, we suggest that transient changes in collective self-esteem can result from priming national identity, and that such changes may transmit links between national identity and evaluations of immigrants among conservatives.

Variants of this question have preoccupied researchers in a wide range of domains, from mainstream experimental psychology (cognition, perception, social behavior) to cognitive neuroscience and behavioral economics. A pervasive view places a heavy explanatory burden on an intelligent cognitive unconscious, with many theories assigning causally effective roles to unconscious influences. This article presents a novel framework for evaluating these claims and reviews evidence from three major bodies of research in which unconscious factors have been studied: multiple-cue judgment, deliberation without attention, and decisions under uncertainty. Studies of priming (subliminal and primes-to-behavior) and the role of awareness in movement and perception (e.g., timing of willed actions, blindsight) are also given brief consideration. The review highlights that inadequate procedures for assessing awareness, failures to consider artifactual explanations of ""landmark"" results, and a tendency to uncritically accept conclusions that fit with our intuitions have all contributed to unconscious influences being ascribed inflated and erroneous explanatory power in theories of decision making. The review concludes by recommending that future research should focus on tasks in which participants' attention is diverted away from the experimenter's hypothesis, rather than the highly reflective tasks that are currently often employed.","[Newell, Ben R.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Shanks, David R.] UCL, Div Psychol & Language Sci, London WC1H 0AP, England","Newell, BR (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",ben.newell@unsw.edu.au; d.shanks@ucl.ac.uk,"Shanks, David/A-1510-2015","Shanks, David/0000-0002-4600-6323",,,,472,149,153,41,531,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0140-525X,1469-1825,,BEHAV BRAIN SCI,Behav.

New experimental tools and statistical techniques make it easier to routinely sample stimuli, and to appropriately treat them as random factors. We encourage researchers to get into the habit of including multiple versions of the content (e.g., stimuli or vignettes) in their designs, to increase confidence in cross-stimulus generalization and to yield more realistic estimates of effect size. We call on editors to be aware of the challenges inherent in such stimulus sampling, to expect and tolerate unexplained variability in observed effect size between stimuli, and to encourage stimulus sampling instead of the deceptively cleaner picture offered by the current reliance on single stimuli.","[Monin, Benoit] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Oppenheimer, Daniel M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA","Monin, B (reprint author), Stanford Grad Sch Business, Knight Management Ctr, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",monin@stanford.edu,"Vianello, Michelangelo/G-8919-2013","Vianello, Michelangelo/0000-0002-1530-1469",,,,10,17,17,0,10,HOGREFE & HUBER PUBLISHERS,GOTTINGEN,"ROHNSWEG 25, D-37085 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY",1864-9335,2151-2590,,SOC PSYCHOL-GERMANY,Soc.

Performance on the task was enhanced after exposure to the achievement related words. Bargh and colleagues concluded that better performance was due to the achievement words having activated a ""high-performance goal"". Because the paper has been cited well over 1100 times, an attempt to replicate its findings would seem warranted. Two direct replication attempts were performed. Results from the first experiment (n = 98) found no effect of priming, and the means were in the opposite direction from those reported by Bargh and colleagues. The second experiment followed up on the observation by Bargh et al. (2001) that high-performance-goal priming was enhanced by a 5-minute delay between priming and test. Adding such a delay, we still found no evidence for high-performance-goal priming (n = 66). These failures to replicate, along with other recent results, suggest that the literature on goal priming requires some skeptical scrutiny.","[Harris, Christine R.; Coburn, Noriko; Pashler, Harold] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Rohrer, Doug] Univ S Florida, Dept Psychol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Harris, CR (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",charris@ucsd.edu,,,James S.

However, the relevance of deliberative processing for political preferences has been highly debated, putting automatic processes in the focus of attention. Based on this notion, the present study tested whether brain responses reflect participants' preferences for politicians and their associated political parties in the absence of explicit deliberation and attention. Participants were instructed to perform a demanding visual fixation task while their brain responses were measured using fMRI. Occasionally, task-irrelevant images of German politicians from two major competing parties were presented in the background while the distraction task was continued. Subsequent to scanning, participants' political preferences for these politicians and their affiliated parties were obtained. Brain responses in distinct brain areas predicted automatic political preferences at the different levels of abstraction: activation in the ventral striatum was positively correlated with preference ranks for unattended politicians, whereas participants' preferences for the affiliated political parties were reflected in activity in the insula and the cingulate cortex. Using an additional donation task, we showed that the automatic preference-related processing in the brain extended to real-world behavior that involved actual financial loss to participants. Together, these findings indicate that brain responses triggered by unattended and task-irrelevant political images reflect individual political preferences at different levels of abstraction.

This question can be understood either as a proximate ""how"" question or as an ultimate ""why"" question. The ""how"" question is about the mental and social mechanisms that produce moral judgments and interactions, and has been investigated by psychologists and social scientists. The ""why"" question is about the fitness consequences that explain why humans have morality, and has been discussed by evolutionary biologists in the context of the evolution of cooperation. Our goal here is to contribute to a fruitful articulation of such proximate and ultimate explanations of human morality. We develop an approach to morality as an adaptation to an environment in which individuals were in competition to be chosen and recruited in mutually advantageous cooperative interactions. In this environment, the best strategy is to treat others with impartiality and to share the costs and benefits of cooperation equally. Those who offer less than others will be left out of cooperation; conversely, those who offer more will be exploited by their partners. In line with this mutualistic approach, the study of a range of economic games involving property rights, collective actions, mutual help and punishment shows that participants' distributions aim at sharing the costs and benefits of interactions in an impartial way. In particular, the distribution of resources is influenced by effort and talent, and the perception of each participant's rights on the resources to be distributed.","[Baumard, Nicolas] Univ Oxford, Inst Cognit & Evolutionary Anthropol, Oxford OX2 6PN, England; [Baumard, Nicolas] Univ Penn, Philosophy Polit & Econ Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Andre, Jean-Baptiste] Ecole Normale Super, Lab Ecol & Evolut, CNRS, UMR 7625, F-75005 Paris, France; [Sperber, Dan] CNRS, EHESS, ENS, Inst Jean Nicod, F-75005 Paris, France; [Sperber, Dan] Cent European Univ, Dept Cognit Sci, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Sperber, Dan] Cent European Univ, Dept Philosophy, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary","Baumard, N (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Inst Cognit & Evolutionary Anthropol, Oxford OX2 6PN, England.",nbaumard@gmail.com; jeanbaptisteandre@gmail.com; dan@sperber.fr,"Andre, Jean-Baptiste/D-1634-2018","Andre, Jean-Baptiste/0000-0001-9069-447X",,,,543,163,166,7,200,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0140-525X,1469-1825,,BEHAV BRAIN SCI,Behav.

An audio-based priming technique was used to assess the causal impact of the radio drama. Rwandan participants (N=842) listened to an audio-delivered questionnaire recorded either in the voice of a main character of the radio drama (experimental priming condition) or an unknown actor (control condition). Participants primed with the radio drama reported higher levels of historical perspective-taking, engaged less in competitive victimhood, and expressed less mistrust toward the out-group. Overall, the findings suggest that fictional radio dramas can be used to address opposing historical narratives in the aftermath of violent conflict. Additionally, the study demonstrates the usefulness of a priming paradigm to assess causal influence of mass media interventions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
