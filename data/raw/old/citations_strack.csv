Given this enormous investment, it seems timely to assess what has been learned and what can be learned from this type of project. My evaluation addresses four questions: First, do these replication studies inform us about the replicability of social psychological research? Second, can replications detect fraud? Third, does the failure to replicate a finding indicate that the original result was wrong? Finally, do these replications help to support or disprove any social psychological theories? Although evidence of replication failures resulted in important methodological changes, the 2015 Open Science Collaboration findings sufficed to make the point. To assess the state of social psychology, we have to evaluate theories rather than randomly selected research findings.","[Stroebe, Wolfgang] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands","Stroebe, W (reprint author), Univ Groningen, Dept Social & Org Res, Grote Kruisstr 2-1, NL-9712 TS Groningen, Netherlands.",wolfgang.stroebe@gmail.com,,,,,,70,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0197-3533,1532-4834,,BASIC APPL SOC PSYCH,Basic Appl Soc.

Cleaning was found to affect negative, neutral, and mildly positive states. We extend this influence to success, a self-serving state. We manipulated success vs. failure and measured changes in optimism (Experiment 1) or self-esteem (Experiment 2). Moreover, we examined boundary conditions for the clean-slate effect. Experiment 1 indicates that the influence of performance on optimism diminishes if participants knew (compared to did not know) they were cleaning their hands. Experiment 2 indicates that the influence of performance on self-esteem diminishes if participants cleaned themselves (compared to an object). These results suggest that the clean-slate effect requires both awareness and self-reference of the cleaning act. Thus, the clean-slate effect seems to depend on both conscious inferences and automatic processes. A meta-analysis across the experiments confirms a moderate-sized clean-slate effect.","[Koerner, Anita; Strack, Fritz] Univ Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany","Korner, A (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Rontgenring 10, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",anita.koerner@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,61,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-4545,1940-1183,,J SOC PSYCHOL,J.

Treatment with this product may improve facial aesthetics, projected first impression, and self-perception of mood. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of perioral rejuvenation with hyaluronic acid on patient perception of mood and projected first impression. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventeen subjects underwent perioral rejuvenation treatment with small-particle hyaluronic acid filler. Each subject underwent photography and completed 2 surveys measuring self-perception of mood before treatment and after achieving an optimal cosmetic result. Aesthetic improvement with treatment was assessed using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale and the Oral Commissure Severity and Perioral Line Severity scales. Seventeen hundred blinded evaluators rated pre-treatment and post-treatment photographs of the subjects using a First Impressions Questionnaire. RESULTS Perioral filler treatment significantly improved pre-treatment and post-treatment scores for happiness within the Happiness Measures Scale. This treatment was found to significantly improve projected first impression across all categories. CONCLUSION Small-particle hyaluronic acid filler treatment for perioral rejuvenation is an effective method for improving physical appearance as well as first impressions. Larger studies are necessary to verify whether perioral rejuvenation with hyaluronic acid offers enhanced self-perception of mood.","[Dayan, Steven H.; Bacos, Jonathan T.; Gandhi, Nimit D.; Kalbag, Arjun] DeNova Res, 845 N Michigan Ave,Suite 923E, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Dayan, Steven H.] Chicago Ctr Facial Plast Surg, Chicago, IL USA; [Dayan, Steven H.; Ho, Thuy-Van T.] Univ Illinois, Dept Otolaryngol, Div Facial Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Chicago, IL USA; [Bacos, Jonathan T.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Dayan, SH (reprint author), DeNova Res, 845 N Michigan Ave,Suite 923E, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",sdayan@drdayan.com,,,"Galderma Laboratories, L.P.","Supported by a grant from Galderma Laboratories, L.P. to S.H.

The most important development in this field is the fruitful adoption of cognitive psychology paradigms to study automatic evaluation processes, for example. This has led to a plethora of findings and theories. Two points are emphasised: First, the (often metaphorical) theoretical way of thinking has changed over the decades. Theorising with symbolic models (e.g. semantic networks), which was prevalent in earlier years, has been replaced more recently by subsymbolic models (i.e. PDP models). It is argued that - despite their still metaphorical character - the latter are better suited to capturing characteristics of emotional processes. Second, the field has adopted the methods of experimental cognitive psychology to develop and refine paradigms as windows to the mind.","[Wentura, Dirk] Saarland Univ, Dept Psychol, Fac Behav Sci, Saarbrucken, Germany","Wentura, D (reprint author), Saarland Univ, Dept Psychol, Fac Behav Sci, Saarbrucken, Germany.",wentura@mx.uni-saarland.de,,"Wentura, Dirk/0000-0001-9907-498X",,,,78,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-9931,1464-0600,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

The present research aimed at filling this gap, demonstrating the impact of phasic (temporally short-lived) affect on evaluative priming effects. In doing so, we addressed the shortcomings of previous research as we implemented affective contexts that changed from trial to trial in a within-participants design. In Experiments 1 and 2, brief positive music excerpts yielded a reliable evaluative priming effect, whereas brief negative excerpts inhibited it. In Experiment 3, we replicated and generalized these findings using a proprioceptive facial feedback procedure. Our results corroborate and extend previous research by showing that brief negative affect inhibits priming effects as compared to brief positive affect or a control condition. These findings attest to the flexibility of the evaluative priming effect and suggest it is permeable to subtle affective contexts that influence its magnitude.","[Lemonnier, Aurore; Alexopoulos, Theodore] Univ Paris 05, Paris, France","Alexopoulos, T (reprint author), Inst Psychol, Lab Psychol Sociale Contextes & Regulat EA 4471, 71 Av Edouard Vaillant, F-92100 Boulogne, France.",theodore.alexopoulos@parisdescartes.fr,,,,,,48,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0001-6918,1873-6297,,ACTA PSYCHOL,Acta Psychol.,JAN,2019,192,,,,,,94,103,,10.1016/j.actpsy.2018.11.001,,,,10,"Psychology, Experimental",Psychology,HI9EW,WOS:000456759100010,30465938,,,,4/26/19

While these wide accounts override traditional methodological individualism, the study of cognition has already progressed beyond these proposed perspectives toward building integrated explanations of the mechanisms involved, including not only internal submechanisms but also interactions with others, groups, cognitive artifacts, and their environment. Wide perspectives are essentially research heuristics for building mechanistic explanations. The claim is substantiated with reference to recent developments in the study of ""mindreading"" and debates on emotions. We argue that the current practice in cognitive (neuro)science has undergone, in effect, a silent mechanistic revolution, and has turned from initial binary oppositions and abstract proposals toward the integration of wide perspectives with the rest of the cognitive (neuro)sciences.","[Malkowski, Marcin; Rucinska, Zuzanna; Hohol, Mateusz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Philosophy & Sociol, Warsaw, Poland; [Clowes, Robert] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Human & Social Sci, Lisbon, Portugal; [Przegalinska, Aleksandra] Kozminski Univ, Dept Int Management, Warsaw, Poland; [Zawidzki, Tadeusz] George Washington Univ, Dept Philosophy, Washington, DC USA; [Krueger, Joel] Univ Exeter, Dept Sociol Philosophy & Anthropol, Exeter, Devon, England; [Gies, Adam] Clemson Univ, Dept Philosophy & Relig, Clemson, SC USA; [McGann, Marek] Univ Limerick, Mary Immaculate Coll, Dept Psychol, Limerick, Ireland; [Afeltowicz, Lukasz] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Inst Sociol, Torun, Poland; [Wachowski, Witold] Univ Warsaw, Inst Philosophy, Warsaw, Poland; [Stjernberg, Fredrik] Linkoping Univ, Fac Arts & Humanities, Linkoping, Sweden; [Loughlin, Victor] Univ Antwerp, Dept Philosophy, Antwerp, Belgium; [Hohol, Mateusz] Jagiellonian Univ, Copernicus Ctr Interdisciplinary Studies, Krakow, Poland","Hohol, M (reprint author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Philosophy & Sociol, Warsaw, Poland.; Hohol, M (reprint author), Jagiellonian Univ, Copernicus Ctr Interdisciplinary Studies, Krakow, Poland.",mateusz.hohol@uj.edu.pl,"Milkowski, Marcin/L-5642-2013; Hohol, Mateusz/E-8576-2013","Milkowski, Marcin/0000-0001-7646-5742; Przegalinska, Aleksandra/0000-0003-0864-8007; Hohol, Mateusz/0000-0003-0422-5488",FET Open Coordinated Action FP7-ICT-2009-C Project [286370],"This manuscript is partly based on the unpublished report of The European Network for Social Intelligence, SINTELNET (FET Open Coordinated Action FP7-ICT-2009-C Project No. 286370).

This model incorporates recent insights from emotion theory, computational neuroscience, and large-scale network models of brain function. It also highlights several domain general processes - including those underlying conceptualization, automatic attention, habit formation, and cognitive control - that offer plausible targets for improving EI with training. Our model offers considerable promise in advancing understanding of intelligent emotional functioning and in guiding future neuroscience research on EI.","[Smith, Ryan; Killgore, William D.

Taking public moods seriously as an analytical concept, this article relies on recent work on the moods of individuals as a means of exploring the moods of the public. To be in a certain mood is to attune oneself to the situation in which one finds oneself. Our mood is the report we give on the state of our attunement. A public mood can either be understood as the mood of a certain age, the mood of an audience which jointly attends to a public performance, or the bonding which takes places between bodies which are in close physical proximity to each other. It is in the public mood that emotions, thoughts and plans for action arise.","[Ringmar, Erik] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden","Ringmar, E (reprint author), Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Box 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",erik@ringmar.net,,,,,,95,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1368-4310,1461-7137,,EUR J SOC THEORY,Eur.

Further, little research is done on how affect moderates the sleep-pain relationship after sleep fragmentation. The present study sought to clarify the relationship between pain, sleep and positive and negative affect. Methods: In an experimental counterbalanced crossover design, 35 healthy young adults were subjected to several pain measures after one night of fragmented sleep, compared to one control night of normal sleep, both conducted in their own homes, and respectively, positive and negative affect induction using validated film clips and facial feedback procedures. Sleep was monitored using sleep diaries. Results: Increased pain sensitivity after one night of experimentally induced sleep fragmentation was found, compared to after one control night of undisturbed sleep. No main effects of induced affect on pain were found, and sleep x induced affect interaction was not significant. Conclusion: The present study supports the adverse effect of sleep fragmentation on pain sensitivity, however, affect was not found to be a moderator in the sleep-pain relationship. The results underline the need for further research within this field.","[Rosseland, Ragna; Pallesen, Stale] Univ Bergen, Dept Psychosocial Sci, Bergen, Norway; [Pallesen, Stale; Blagestad, Tone] Haukeland Hosp, Notwegian Competence Ctr Sleep Disorders, Bergen, Norway; [Nordhus, Inger Hilde] Univ Bergen, Dept Clin Psychol, Bergen, Norway; [Nordhus, Inger Hilde] Univ Oslo, Dept Behav Sci Med, Oslo, Norway; [Matre, Dagfinn] Natl Inst Occupat Hlth, Dept Work Psychol & Physiol, Oslo, Norway","Rosseland, R (reprint author), Univ Bergen, Dept Psychosocial Sci, Bergen, Norway.",Ragna.Rosseland@student.uib.no,,,Research Council of Norway,"This research was supported by a grant from The Research Council of Norway.

Research shows that this cosmetic treatment leads to a reduction in depression. This reduction is consistent with the theory of embodied emotions because patients have a reduced ability to frown and so receive less negative feedback associated with this action. The current research explored this effect and three further hypotheses for the effects of cosmetic BTX injections based on embodied emotions. It was hypothesised that treatment of crow's feet (or laughter lines) would reduce mood as patients' Duchenne smiles would be impaired. It was hypothesised that facial BTX treatments would impair emotional expression recognition because the ability to mimic emotions would be reduced. Finally, it was hypothesised that, as BTX treatments prevent facial expressions associated with sexual excitement, sexual function would be impaired after treatment. Twenty four BTX-treated and twelve matched participants (all female) were tested before and after treatment. Results found that BTX treatment of laughter lines was associated with increased depression scores. Further, BTX treatment was associated with reduced emotion recognition ability and sexual function. The current results add to our knowledge of the psychological effects of injections of powerful neurotoxins and broaden the scope of the embodiment of emotions.","[Lewis, Michael B.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales","Lewis, MB (reprint author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.",LewisMB@Cardiff.ac.uk,,"Lewis, Michael/0000-0002-5735-5318",,,,52,1,1,8,11,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,3-Oct,2018,8,,,,,,,,14720,10.1038/s41598-018-33119-1,,,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,GV7US,WOS:000446339400004,30283017,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,4/26/19

This work explores whether product orientation affects the product evaluations communicated by swiping movements, compared with those made by pressing onscreen buttons. Building on stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) theory, which suggests that irrelevant product display features can activate certain behavioral responses when the product display and the behavioral response share a common dimension, this study predicts that the horizontal direction (left to right or right to left) cued by a product's orientation should facilitate a swipe movement in the congruent direction. Five studies indicate that when people use swiping movements to evaluate objects, their evaluations are influenced by the object's orientation, whereas evaluations conveyed through button presses reveal no orientation effect. The orientation effect for swiping responses also disappears when the objects contain a direction cue that is incongruent with their orientation, and when only one directional swipe movement is defined as a valid response option. Moreover, the effect holds for subjective evaluations but is eliminated for objective judgments, when these involve no time pressure.","[Van Kerckhove, Anneleen] Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Mkt, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Pandelaere, Mario] Virginia Tech, Pamplin Coll Business, Mkt, 880 West Campus Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Van Kerckhove, A (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Mkt, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",anneleen.vankerckhove@ugent.be; mpand@vt.edu,,,Flemish Fund for Scientific Research [G020215N],This research was supported by funding through the Flemish Fund for Scientific Research to the second author (grant G020215N).,,66,0,0,24,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0093-5301,1537-5277,,J CONSUM RES,J.

Some of the best-known examples include the mil/mal effect (Sapir, Journal of Experimental Psychology, 12, 225-239, 1929) and the maluma/takete effect (Kohler, 1929). Interest in this topic has been on the rise within psychology, and studies have demonstrated that sound symbolic effects are relevant for many facets of cognition, including language, action, memory, and categorization. Sound symbolism also provides a mechanism by which words' forms can have nonarbitrary, iconic relationships with their meanings. Although various proposals have been put forth for how phonetic features (both acoustic and articulatory) come to be associated with stimuli, there is as yet no generally agreed-upon explanation. We review five proposals: statistical co-occurrence between phonetic features and associated stimuli in the environment, a shared property among phonetic features and stimuli; neural factors; species-general, evolved associations; and patterns extracted from language. We identify a number of outstanding questions that need to be addressed on this topic and suggest next steps for the field.","[Sidhu, David M.; Pexman, Penny M.] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","Sidhu, DM (reprint author), Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.",dsidhu@ucalgary.ca,,"Pexman, Penny/0000-0001-7130-0973",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Alberta Innovates: Health Solutions (AIHS),"This research was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) through a postgraduate scholarship to D.M.S. and a Discovery Grant to P.M.P., and by Alberta Innovates: Health Solutions (AIHS) through a graduate scholarship to D.M.S.",,200,4,4,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1069-9384,1531-5320,,PSYCHON B REV,Psychon.

Accordingly, sensorimotor and visual processes should provide congruent emotional information about a facial expression. Here, we report evidence that challenges this view. Specifically, the repeated execution of facial expressions has the opposite effect on the recognition of a subsequent facial expression than the repeated viewing of facial expressions. Moreover, the findings of the motor condition, but not of the visual condition, were correlated with a nonsensory condition in which participants imagined an emotional situation. These results can be well accounted for by the idea that facial expression recognition is not always mediated by motor processes but can also be recognized on visual information alone.","[de la Rosa, Stephan; Fademrecht, Laura; Buelthoff, Heinrich H.; Curio, Cristobal] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Dept Human Percept Cognit & Act, Spemannstr 38, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Giese, Martin A.] Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Hertie Inst Clin Brain Res, Dept Cognit Neurol, Tubingen, Germany; [Curio, Cristobal] Reutlingen Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Reutlingen, Germany","de la Rosa, S; Bulthoff, HH; Curio, C (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Dept Human Percept Cognit & Act, Spemannstr 38, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",delarosa@tuebingen.mpg.de; heinrich.buelthoff@tuebingen.mpg.de; Cristobal.Curio@reutlingen-university.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [PAK38 CU 149/1-1/2]; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) [13 FH 049 PX 5]; European Union Future and Emerging Technologies-Open Project TANGO; Human Frontier Science Program [RGP0036/2016]; DFG GZ [KA 1258/15-1]; European Commission H2020 project CogIMon H2020 [ICT-644727]; BMBF [FKZ 01GQ1704],"C.

Residents of countries characterized by high ancestral diversity display emotion expressions that are easier to decode by observers, endorse norms of higher emotion expressivity, and smile more in response to certain stimuli than residents of countries that lack ancestral diversity. We build on the extant findings and investigate historical heterogeneity as a predictor of daily smiling, laughter, and positive emotion across the world's countries and the states of the United States. Study 1 finds that historical heterogeneity is positively associated with self-reports of smiling, laughter, and positive emotions in the Gallup World Poll when controlling for GDP and present-day population diversity. Study 2 extends the findings to effects of long-history migration within the United States. We estimated the average percentage of foreign-born citizens in each state between 1850 and 2010 based on US Census information as an indicator of historical heterogeneity. Consistent with the world findings of Study 1, historical heterogeneity predicted smiling, laughter, and positive, but not negative, emotion. The relationships remained significant when controlling for per capita income and present-day population diversity of each state. Together, the findings further demonstrate the important role of long-history migration in shaping emotion cultures of countries and states, which persist beyond the original socioecological conditions, and open promising avenues for cross-cultural research.","[Niedenthal, Paula M.; Wood, Adrienne; Zhao, Fangyun] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Rychlowska, Magdalena] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Psychol, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland","Rychlowska, M (reprint author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Psychol, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",M.Rychlowska@qub.ac.uk,,"Zhao, Fangyun/0000-0002-3057-9733",2017-2018 Cattell Sabbatical Award from the James McKeen Cattell Fund [MSN206694]; Emotion Research Training Grant from the National Institute of Mental Health [T32MH018931-24]; Nuffield Foundation,"P.M.N. was supported by a 2017-2018 Cattell Sabbatical Award (MSN206694) from the James McKeen Cattell Fund.

Playing a submissive role during BDSM practice weakens both the behavioral and neural empathic responses of female individuals to others' suffering, suggesting that long-term BDSM experience affects BDSM practitioners' empathic ability. This study further investigates whether physical restriction during BDSM practice also modulates individuals' neural responses to others' suffering. We measured neural responses to others' suffering by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) in female submissives while they viewed painful and neutral expressions in sexual sadistic/general social contexts under ball gag Blocking and Relaxed conditions. The neural responses recorded during 92-112 ms (N1), 132-172 ms (P2), 200-340 ms (N2), early late positive potential (LPP, 400-600 ms), and late LPP (700-1,000 ms) were included in the analyses. Compared to the relaxed condition, when a ball gag was used to prevent facial muscle movement and facial mimicry, the N1, early LPP, and late LPP responses neural responses to others' suffering were inhibited. The moderation effect of ball gag blocking on the N1 and early LPP amplitudes was positively correlated with the subjective feelings of facial muscle stillness, and the blocking moderation effect on the late LPP amplitudes was positively correlated with subjective feelings of humiliation. This study is the first neuropsychological investigation of the transient BDSM-related physical restriction effects on BDSM practitioners. These findings suggest that physical restriction (via a ball gag) during BDSM practices increases the wearer's facial muscle stillness and sense of humiliation. This physical restriction inhibits both early automatic responses and late controlled processes in response to the suffering of others.","[Luo, Siyang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Psychol, Guangdong Key Lab Social Cognit Neurosci & Mental, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Luo, Siyang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Psychol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Brain Funct & Dis, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiao] Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Luo, SY (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Psychol, Guangdong Key Lab Social Cognit Neurosci & Mental, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Luo, SY (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Psychol, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Brain Funct & Dis, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",siyangluo@pku.edu.cn,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [16wkpy28]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2017A030310553]; Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [17YJCZH121]; Guangdong Educational, Scientific, Cultural, and Health Industry Workers' Trade Union [2018jkwwgh009]","This work was supported by grants from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities grant (Project 16wkpy28), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Project 2017A030310553), the Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (Project 17YJCZH121), and the Guangdong Educational, Scientific, Cultural, and Health Industry Workers' Trade Union (Project 2018jkwwgh009).",,44,0,0,6,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-453X,,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

It leads to increased feeling of closeness toward the mimicker as well as greater liking, suggesting close bidirectional links with reward. In recent work using eye-gaze tracking, we have demonstrated that the reward value of being mimicked, measured using a preferential looking paradigm, is directly proportional to trait empathy (Neufeld and Chakrabarti, 2016). In the current manuscript, we investigated the reward value of the act of mimicking, using a simple task manipulation that involved allowing or inhibiting spontaneous facial mimicry in response to dynamic expressions of positive emotion. We found greater reward-related neural activity in response to the condition where mimicry was allowed compared to that where mimicry was inhibited. The magnitude of this link from mimicry to reward response was positively correlated to trait empathy.","[Hsu, Chun-Ting; Sims, Thomas; Chakrabarti, Bhismadev] Univ Reading, Ctr Integrat Neurosci & Neurodynam, Sch Psychol & Clin Language Sci, Reading RG6 6AL, Berks, England; [Hsu, Chun-Ting] Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, Brain Language & Computat Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Chakrabarti, B (reprint author), Univ Reading, Sch Psychol & Clin Language Sci, Reading RG6 6AL, Berks, England.",b.chakrabarti@reading.ac.uk,,"Hsu, Chun-Ting/0000-0002-1829-6642",University of Reading; MRC [G1100359/1],The authors would like to thank Rob Clarke and Tom Johnstone for helpful discussions.TBS was supported by a PhD studentship from the University of Reading.

Many journals and reviewers view manipulation checks favorably, and they are widely reported in prestigious journals. However, the prototypical manipulation check is a verbal (rather than behavioral) measure that always appears at the same point in the procedure (rather than its order being varied to assess order effects). Embedding such manipulation checks within an experiment comes with problems. While we conceptualize manipulation checks as measures, they can also act as interventions which initiate new processes that would otherwise not occur. The default assumption that manipulation checks do not affect experimental conclusions is unwarranted. They may amplify, undo, or interact with the effects of a manipulation. Further, the use of manipulation checks in mediational analyses does not rule out confounding variables, as any unmeasured variables that correlate with the manipulation check may still drive the relationship. Alternatives such as non-verbal and behavioral measures as manipulation checks and pilot testing are less problematic. Reviewers should view manipulation checks more critically, and authors should explore alternative methods to ensure the effectiveness of manipulations.","[Hauser, David J.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Ellsworth, Phoebe C.; Gonzalez, Richard] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hauser, David J.] Queens Univ, Dept Psychol, Kingston, ON, Canada","Hauser, DJ (reprint author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.; Hauser, DJ (reprint author), Queens Univ, Dept Psychol, Kingston, ON, Canada.",davidhau@usc.edu,,,,,,60,1,1,7,11,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

The results showed that only recognition accuracy of a sad facial expression was influenced simultaneously by bidirectional sources from a sender and observer. Moreover, the impact of the unidirectional cue of a sender's facial feature (i.e., mouth openness) on happy and neutral faces was found to influence the recognition accuracy of these faces, but not the observer's bodily state.

A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that TCQ may be beneficial for psychological health, including management and prevention of depression and anxiety. Although a variety of causal factors have been identified as potential mediators of such health benefits, physical posture, despite its visible prominence, has been largely overlooked. We hypothesize that body posture while standing and/or moving may be a key therapeutic element mediating the influence of TCQ on psychological health. In the present paper, we summarize existing experimental and observational evidence that suggests a bi-directional relationship between body posture and mental states. Drawing from embodied cognitive science, we provide a theoretical framework for further investigation into this interrelationship. We discuss the challenges involved in such an investigation and propose suggestions for future studies. Despite theoretical and practical challenges, we propose that the role of posture in mind-body exercises such as TCQ should be considered in future research.","[Osypiuk, Kamila; Wayne, Peter M.] Harvard Med Sch, Osher Ctr Integrat Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Prevent Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Thompson, Evan] Univ British Columbia, Dept Philosophy, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Osypiuk, K (reprint author), Harvard Med Sch, Osher Ctr Integrat Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Prevent Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",kosypiuk@bwh.harvard.edu,,,National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health/National Institutes of Health [K24AT009282]; Osher Center for Integrative Medicine,This study was supported by grants to PW from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health/National Institutes of Health (K24AT009282) and the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine.,,163,2,2,10,20,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5161,,,FRONT HUM NEUROSCI,Front.

According to the facial-feedback hypothesis, the facial activity associated with particular emotional expressions can influence people's affective experiences. Recently, a replication attempt of this effect in 17 laboratories around the world failed to find any support for the effect. We hypothesize that the reason for the failure of replication is that the replication protocol deviated from that of the original experiment in a critical factor. In all of the replication studies, participants were alerted that they would be monitored by a video camera, whereas the participants in the original study were not monitored, observed, or recorded. Previous findings indicate that feeling monitored or observed reduces reliance on internal cues in making judgments. Therefore, we hypothesize that recording the participants in the replication experiments reduced their reliance on the facial-feedback. To test the hypothesis, we replicated the facial-feedback experiment in 2 conditions: one with a video-camera and one without it. The results revealed a significant facial-feedback effect in the absence of a camera, which was eliminated in the camera's presence. These findings suggest that minute differences in the experimental protocol might lead to theoretically meaningful changes in the outcomes. In our view, the theoretical and methodological approach advocated by our study changes failed replications from being the ""end of the road"" regarding entire fields of study into a new road for growth regarding our understanding of human nature.","[Noah, Tom; Schul, Yaacov; Mayo, Ruth] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Psychol, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel; [Noah, Tom] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Federmann Ctr Study Rat, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel","Noah, T (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Psychol, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel.; Noah, T (reprint author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Federmann Ctr Study Rat, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel.",tom.noah@mail.huji.ac.il,,"schul, yaacov/0000-0002-3301-8835",,,,40,5,5,2,16,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

The systematic observation of emotions allows us to study them ""online"" in their natural context. In addition, the article describes how changes in the observable behavior entail relevant consequences to the individual him-or herself as well as to others (e.g., the opponent) that can hardly be explained by the subjective experience of an emotion.

Using the voluntary facial action technique, in which the participants react with instruction induced smiles and frowns when exposed to positive and negative emotional pictures and then rate the pleasantness of these stimuli, four questions were addressed in the present study. The results in Experiment 1 demonstrated a feedback effect because participants experienced the stimuli as more pleasant during smiling as compared to when frowning. However, this effect was present only during the critical actions of smiling and frowning, with no remaining effects after 5 min or after 1 day. In Experiment 2, feedback effects were found only when the facial action (smile/frown) was incongruent with the presented emotion (positive/negative), demonstrating attenuating but not enhancing modulation. Finally, no difference in the intensity of produced feedback effect was found between smiling and frowning, and no difference in feedback effect was found between positive and negative emotions.

It is therefore important to study how individual differences in behavioral control arise. Previous studies suggest that there are both genetic and environmental influences, which were estimated in the current study using a sample of mono-and dizygotic same-sex twins. Furthermore, we examined the associations between indicators of a stressful family environment like household chaos, parenting daily hassles, and parental depressive symptoms and children's behavioral control in 2 samples. Children of the same twin pair were randomly divided over 2 samples; a test (N = 201, 48.3% boys, M age 46.53 months) and replication sample (N = 201, 49.8% boys, M age 46.06 months). Both parents reported on their children's effortful control via the Child Behavior Questionnaire and children's cheating behavior was observed during a throwing game. We found that AE models fitted the data for effortful control (A = 31%, E = 69%) and cheating (A = 16%, E = 84%) best. Path analyses revealed that children of parents experiencing more parenting daily hassles and depressive symptoms had lower levels of effortful control in the test sample. Furthermore, we found that children growing up in more chaotic households (parent report) had an increased risk of being in the cheating group versus the possible intention to cheat group in the test sample. These results were partially replicated. We suggest that the role of stressful family environments in the development of behavioral control should be considered when setting up prevention and intervention programs targeting children's behavioral control.","[Vrijhof, Claudia I.; van IJzendoorn, Marinus H.; Euser, Saskia] Leiden Univ, Inst Educ & Child Studies, Leiden Consortium Individual Dev, Pieter de la Court Gebouw,Postbus 9555, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands; [Vrijhof, Claudia I.; van der Voort, Anja; van IJzendoorn, Marinus H.; Euser, Saskia] Leiden Univ, Ctr Child & Family Studies, Inst Educ & Child Studies, Pieter de la Court Gebouw,Postbus 9555, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands","van IJzendoorn, MH (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Inst Educ & Child Studies, Leiden Consortium Individual Dev, Pieter de la Court Gebouw,Postbus 9555, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands.; van IJzendoorn, MH (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Ctr Child & Family Studies, Inst Educ & Child Studies, Pieter de la Court Gebouw,Postbus 9555, NL-2300 RB Leiden, Netherlands.",vanijzen@fsw.leidenuniv.nl,,,"Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [024.001.003]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research","The authors thank the families for their participation in the L-CID preschooler project and the people involved in the data collection, especially Rani C.

In Experiment 2 (n = 50), we interfered with the AON by applying transcranial Direct Current Stimulation to the motor cortex. In both experiments, we found that interfering with the AON impaired the performance of participants with high empathy levels; however, for the first time, we demonstrated that the interference enhanced the performance of participants with low empathy.

We have demonstrated that findings that have been attributed to an embodied cognition account can also be explained by language statistics, because language encodes perceptual information. We investigated whether comprehension of emotion words can be explained by an embodied cognition or a language statistics account. A corpus linguistic study comparing emotions words showed that words denoting the same emotions (happy-delighted) co-occur more frequently than different emotions (happy-angry). These findings were used in two experiments in which participants read same-emotion and different-emotion sentence pairs. Sentence pairs with different emotions yielded longer RTs than sentences with the same emotions both in a cognitive task tailored toward linguistic representations and a task tailored toward embodied representations. These findings contribute to a growing body of literature that demonstrates that language processing does not always rely solely on perceptual simulation.","[Tillman, Richard] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Psychol, POB 210376, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Louwerse, Max] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Ctr Cognit & Commun, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands","Tillman, R (reprint author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Psychol, POB 210376, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",richardntillman@gmail.com,,,,,,21,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0090-6905,1573-6555,,J PSYCHOLINGUIST RES,J.

Here, we focus on the corresponding influence in the opposite direction. By means of an anagram-solving task we investigated whether activating spatial experiential traces would activate the corresponding concepts, which in turn facilitates access to associated words. Participants solved anagrams of nouns associated with the ocean or the sky (e.g. dolphin=dplhion or cloud=cdulo). In six experiments we provided additional context information such as positional information (presenting the anagram at the top or the bottom of the screen), or pictorial information that either matched the ocean and sky theme or not, or both positional and pictorial information. Anagrams were solved faster when the position of the anagram was congruent with the location of the noun's referent in the real world, but only when presented on the background of an ocean-sky picture. Thus, activating experiential traces indeed seems to activate related concepts but positional information alone is not enough to find facilitation in an anagram solving task. Rather what is needed is a whole set of traces that sufficiently narrow down the number of related concepts.","[Berndt, Eduard; Dudschig, Carolin; Kaup, Barbara] Univ Tubingen, Psychol Inst, Schleichstr 4, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Berndt, E (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Psychol Inst, Schleichstr 4, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",eduard.berndt@uni-tuebingen.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the Collaborative Research Center [SFB 833],"This study was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the Collaborative Research Center ""SFB 833""; Project B4 of Barbara Kaup and Hartmut Leuthold.",,40,1,1,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1747-0218,1747-0226,,Q J EXP PSYCHOL,Q.

The strength of the drug approach bias has been associated with clinically relevant measures, such as increased drug craving and relapse, and activations in brain reward areas. Retraining the approach bias by means of cognitive bias modification has been demonstrated to decrease relapse rates in patients with an alcohol use disorder and to reduce alcohol cue-evoked limbic activity. Here, we review empirical and theoretical literature on the drug approach bias and explore two distinct models of how the drug approach bias may be embodied. First, we consider the ""biological meaning"" hypothesis, which grounds the automatic approach bias in the natural meaning of the body. Second, we consider the ""sensorimotor hypothesis,"" which appeals to the specific sensorimotor loops involved in the instantiation of addictive behaviors as the basis of the automatic approach bias.

The predisposing factors exert their influence by creating encoded social cognitions including schemas about the world, scripts for social behavior, and normative beliefs about what is appropriate. These social cognitions interact with situational primes to determine behavior. These social cognitions are acquired primarily through observational learning; so youth who are repeatedly exposed to violence will acquire social cognitions promoting aggression that last into adulthood.

In Experiment 1, participants viewed dynamic angry and happy faces, with facial electromyography recorded from the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii as emotional mimicry. Self-reported emotional experiences were analyzed as emotional contagion. Experiment 2 manipulated social appraisal as the gaze of expression toward the target. The results showed that there was emotional contagion for angry and happy expressions both in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Experiment 1 indicated an overt mimicry pattern for happy faces, but not for angry faces. Experiment 2 found an influence of social appraisal on angry contagion but not on happy diffusion. The two experiments suggest that the underlying processes of emotional mimicry and social appraisal are differentially relevant for different emotional contagion, with happiness processing following a mimicry-based path to emotional contagion, and anger processing requiring social appraisal.","[Deng, Huan] Huaibei Normal Univ, Sch Educ, Huaibei, Peoples R China; [Deng, Huan; Hu, Ping] Renmin Univ China, Dept Psychol, Beijing, Peoples R China","Hu, P (reprint author), Renmin Univ China, Dept Psychol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",huping@ruc.edu.cn,,,"Humanities and social science projects - Ministry of Education [13YJA190007]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [12XNLL06, 15XNLQ05]","This work was supported by Humanities and social science projects supported by Ministry of Education (13YJA190007), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (12XNLL06 and 15XNLQ05).",,37,3,3,1,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

This conduct suggests that feelings of self-confidence/powerfulness or distress/sadness change our body expressions/postures. It can be interesting to assess whether the reverse is also true, i.e. the way we arrange our body at a given moment would affect our feelings. The present research reports an investigation on such argument. To this aim, 50 subjects (25 females) aged between 23 and 31 years were requested to adopt either an expansive (high-powered) or contracted (low-powered) posture for as long as 3 minutes and then asked to bet money in a dice game. The results show that assuming high-power poses favors risk tolerant behaviors and rises feelings of powerfulness. This is not true in the case of low-power postures, which engender a sense of stress, sustained by a significant increase of skin conductance levels.

Most research into this area contends that progressive cognitive decline accompanying the disease is to be blamed. However, facial mimicry (i.e., the involuntary congruent activation of facial expression muscles upon viewing a particular facial expression) might also play a role and has been relatively understudied in this clinical population. In healthy participants, facial mimicry has been shown to improve recognition of observed emotions, a phenomenon described by embodied simulation theory. Due to motor disturbances, Parkinson's disease patients frequently show reduced emotional expressiveness, which translates into reduced mimicry. Therefore, it is likely that facial mimicry problems in Parkinson's disease contribute at least partly to the emotional recognition deficits that these patients experience and might greatly influence their social cognition abilities and quality of life. The present review aims to highlight the need for further inquiry into the motor mechanisms behind emotional recognition in Parkinson's disease by synthesizing behavioural, physiological, and neuroanatomical evidence.","[Prenger, Margaret T.

Two versions of the same joke were compared: a version that included an interruption before the punchline and another that did not include an interruption at that point.

The results indicated that the participants who were interrupted before the punchline relied more on their own thoughts in forming their attitudes than did those who were in the control group.

Results: In experiment 1, no effect of enactment or emotion was observed in the AD patients. In experiment 2, effects of enactment and emotion (better recall for negative actions) were observed in the AD patients.

In Experiment 1, we focused on the content of older adults' nostalgic (vs. ordinary) recollections and asked whether older adults' nostalgia could be transferred to younger adults. We showed that nostalgia expressed in older adults' narratives was positively associated with nostalgia reported by young-adult readers. In Experiment 2, undergraduates read a nostalgic or ordinary narrative written by an older adult. Then they rated their own nostalgia as well as their perceived social connectedness, self-continuity, and meaning in life. Exposure to older adults' nostalgic (vs. ordinary) narratives promoted concurrent nostalgia among young adults, along with associated psychological benefits (social connectedness, self-continuity, meaning). The findings illustrate the potential for intergenerational transfer of nostalgia through written narratives, and attest to the universality of nostalgic themes across younger and older adults.","[Wildschut, Tim; Sedikides, Constantine; Robertson, Sara] Univ Southampton, Dept Psychol, Southampton, Hants, England","Wildschut, T (reprint author), Univ Southampton, Dept Psychol, Ctr Res Self & Ident, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",R.T.Wildschut@soton.ac.uk,,"Sedikides, Contantine/0000-0003-4036-889X",,,,100,0,0,3,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-8211,1464-0686,,MEMORY,Memory,,2018,26,8,,,,,1030,1041,,10.1080/09658211.2018.1470645,,,,12,"Psychology, Experimental",Psychology,GJ9EZ,WOS:000435699500002,29724153,,,,4/26/19

However, as cognitive linguists have discerned for many other aspects of language, much of the ways that people speak and understand one another is motivated by people's pervasive bodily experiences. Ironic humor provides another compelling phenomenon in which to understand the embodied foundation of both linguistic meaning and multimodal expression, particularly in terms of rough-and-tumble play. Many forms of humor arise from different benign violations of the body in play fighting. We describe cognitive linguistic and psychological evidence on the importance of bodily experience, and benign violations of the body, in linguistic expressions referring to teasing and humor. Variations of rough-and-tumble play help explain some of the instabilities in the ways ironic humor unfolds in interpersonal interactions.","[Gibbs, Raymond W., Jr.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Psychol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Samermit, Patrawat; Karzmark, Christopher R.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Cognit Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Gibbs, RW (reprint author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Psychol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",raymondwgibbs@gmail.com,,,,,,37,0,0,3,3,JOHN BENJAMINS PUBLISHING CO,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 ME AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1877-9751,1877-976X,,REV COGN LINGUIST,Rev.

In doing so, it explores the nature of explanation itself and raises one crucial question: How much is beyond explanation? In other words, to what extent could translational phenomena be due to mere chance? This article addresses this question by drawing on six landmark experiments within the field of psychology. These experiments suggest (1) that we, as translators, might unknowingly be injecting random elements into our translations, and (2) that we, as Translation Studies scholars, might be 'seeing' causes in that randomness where there are none. This article also draws on psychologist Daniel Kahneman's ideas about the 'illusion of causation' and on Nassim Taleb's definition of randomness within the humanities and social sciences. It concludes by arguing that retrospective explanations of translations should pay far more than lip service to the notion of chance.","[Cohen, Imogen] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Cohen, I (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept English Language & Culture, Spuistr 210, NL-1012 VT Amsterdam, Netherlands.",i.c.cohen@uva.nl,,,,,,43,0,0,1,2,JOHN BENJAMINS PUBLISHING CO,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 ME AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0924-1884,1569-9986,,TARGET-NETH,Target,,2018,30,1,,,,,3,23,,10.1075/target.14124.coh,,,,21,Linguistics; Language & Linguistics,Linguistics,GC4SK,WOS:000429774900002,,,,,4/26/19

Our compassion model is based on public service sector employees who receive compassionate feelings such as affection, generosity, caring, and tenderness from their supervisors. A longitudinal study of 166 public service employees, their supervisors and 333 of their clients (citizens) was conducted in Israel. In this longitudinal study, we found evidence that receipt of compassion from supervisors (at time 1) in the public service workplace was positively associated with employees' sense of work engagement, and negatively related to their work burnout (at time 2). Furthermore, receipt of compassion (at time 1) was also found to impact public service employees' organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and knowledge sharing (at time 2) as rated by their supervisors, as well as their service-oriented performance of compassionate behavior toward clients (at time 2), rated by the citizens. Finally, we found evidence for compassion acting as a mechanism for coping with common stressful public service conditions such as demanding citizens and administrative workload, which are inherent in this sector. Compassion in the public service workplace may therefore be salient in effecting public service work performance, and as such should be consciously targeted by public sector managers and policy makers.","[Eldor, Liat] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Eldor, L (reprint author), Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",leldor@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,152,4,4,14,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1053-1858,1477-9803,,J PUBL ADM RES THEOR,J.

In this article, we review past highlights of and future prospects for the journal. Our tour of history covers three periods: The first period, from 1987 to 1999, was a pioneering era in which cognitive theories began to be applied to the scientific analysis of emotion. The second period, from 2000 to 2007, was characterised by a sharp increase in the number of empirical research papers, a lot of which were concerned with automatic processing biases and their implications for clinical psychology. During the third period, from 2008 to 2017, a new focus emerged on self-regulatory processes and their implications for emotion. We then turn to the present profile of Cognition & Emotion and introduce our new editorial team. Finally, we consider how the journal's future success can be continued and increased by a) providing authors with fast and high-quality feedback; b) offering attractive publication formats, including the newly introduced Registered Reports for pre-registered studies; and c) consolidating key methodological paradigms with reproducible findings.","[Rothermund, Klaus] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Psychol, Jena, Germany; [Koole, Sander L.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Rothermund, K (reprint author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Psychol, Jena, Germany.; Koole, SL (reprint author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",klaus.rothermund@uni-jena.de; s.l.koole@vu.nl,,,,,,85,2,2,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-9931,1464-0600,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

This sparked a period of methodological reflection that we review here and call Psychology's Renaissance. We begin by describing how psychologists' concerns with publication bias shifted from worrying about file-drawered studies to worrying about p-hacked analyses. We then review the methodological changes that psychologists have proposed and, in some cases, embraced. In describing how the renaissance has unfolded, we attempt to describe different points of view fairly but not neutrally, so as to identify the most promising paths forward. In so doing, we champion disclosure and preregistration, express skepticism about most statistical solutions to publication bias, take positions on the analysis and interpretation of replication failures, and contend that meta-analytical thinking increases the prevalence of false positives. Our general thesis is that the scientific practices of experimental psychologists have improved dramatically.","[Nelson, Leif D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Simmons, Joseph; Simonsohn, Uri] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Nelson, LD (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",Leif_Nelson@haas.berkeley.edu; jsimmo@upenn.edu; urisohn@gmail.com,,,,,,130,30,30,18,58,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0066-4308,,978-0-8243-0269-6,ANNU REV PSYCHOL,Annu.

The aim of the current study was to examine how the aggregate well-being of students who comprise a class could predict students' subsequent well-being (Time 2 well-being) after controlling for the effects of prior well-being (Time 1 well-being) as well as key demographic variables such as gender and age. Two studies among Filipino secondary school students were conducted. In Study 1, 788 students from 21 classes participated; in Study 2, 404 students from 10 classes participated. For Study 1, questionnaires assessing students' life satisfaction, positive affect and negative affect were administered twice seven months apart. For Study 2, the well-being questionnaires were administered twice, three months apart. Hierarchical linear modeling was used with level 1 (Time 1 individual well-being, gender, and age) and level 2 (class well-being) predictors. Results across the two studies provided converging lines of evidence: students who were in classes with higher levels of life satisfaction and positive affect were also more likely to have higher life satisfaction and positive affect at Time 2. The study indicated that the well-being of a student partly depends on the well-being of their classmates providing evidence for the social contagion of well-being in the classroom context.","[King, Ronnel B.] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Datu, Jesus Alfonso] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","King, RB (reprint author), Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Tai Po, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ronnel@eduhk.hk,,"KING, Ronnel Bornasal/0000-0002-0648-8508; Datu, Jesus Alfonso/0000-0002-8790-1113",,,,81,2,2,2,14,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0022-4405,1873-3506,,J SCHOOL PSYCHOL,J.

However, they were not asked to intentionally change their emotional state. Observers judged happy expression images as more trustworthy, competent, warm, friendly, and distinctive than disgusted expression images, regardless of the observers' own facial expression. Observers judged disgusted expression images asmore dominant than happy expression images. However, observers expressing disgust overestimated dominance in observed disgusted expression images and underestimated dominance in happy expression images. In contrast, observers with happy facial forms attenuated dominance for disgusted expression images. These results suggest that dominance inferred from facial expressions is unstable and influenced by not only the observed facial expression, but also the observers' own physiological states.","[Ueda, Yoshiyuki; Yoshikawa, Sakiko] Kyoto Univ, Kokoro Res Ctr, Kyoto, Japan; [Nagoya, Kie] Kyoto Univ, Fac Educ, Kyoto, Japan; [Nomura, Michio] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Kyoto, Japan","Ueda, Y (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Kokoro Res Ctr, Kyoto, Japan.",ueda.yoshiyuki.3e@kyoto-u.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [15K00205],"We are deeply grateful to Kazusa Minemoto, who helped us with the experiments, and to Eunsoo Choi for advice on English.

Participants were asked to complete questionnaires measuring their emotion regulation and emotion-related behaviors (supportive vs. unsupportive) with regard to a specific child, noting whether the child had ADHD. Results indicated that parents of children with ADHD used more emotion regulation strategies than parents of children without ADHD. No differences were found in emotion-related behaviors. Patterns of relations between reappraisal and suppression emotion regulation and supportive and non-supportive emotion-related behaviors revealed that parent reappraisal was an effective emotion regulation strategy for both subgroups, whereas suppression was ineffective only for parents of children without ADHD. These findings shed light on the relation of parent reappraisal and suppression strategies to emotion-related behaviors for different parenting experiences and emphasize the importance of addressing parent specific emotion regulation in parenting intervention programs.","[Shenaar-Golan, Vered] Tel Hai Coll, Dept Social Work, IL-1220800 Dn Upper Galilee, Israel; [Wald, Nava; Yatzkar, Uri] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Med, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Yatzkar, Uri] Ziv Med Ctr, Zfat, Israel","Shenaar-Golan, V (reprint author), Tel Hai Coll, Dept Social Work, IL-1220800 Dn Upper Galilee, Israel.",vered.golan7@gmail.com,,,,,,50,0,0,2,14,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0165-1781,,,PSYCHIAT RES,Psychiatry Res.,DEC,2017,258,,,,,,494,500,,10.1016/j.psychres.2017.08.090,,,,7,Psychiatry,Psychiatry,FN7FQ,WOS:000416184500077,28890229,,,,4/26/19

While much work in this area offers fascinating insights to musicological research, assumptions about the nature of emotional experience seem to remain committed to appraisal, representations, and a rule-based or information-processing model of cognition. Over the past three decades alternative 'embodied' and 'enactive' models of mind have challenged this approach by emphasising the self-organising aspects of cognition, often describing it as an ongoing process of dynamic interactivity between an organism and its environment. More recently, this perspective has been applied to the study of emotion in general, opening up interesting new possibilities for theory and research. This new approach, however, has received rather limited attention in musical contexts. With this in mind, we critically review the history of music and emotion studies, arguing that many existing theories offer only limited views of what musical-emotional experience entails.

The present paper attempts to discuss some of the issues raised by emotion researchers, particularly-those in psychology, regarding the nature of emotions. It is argued that many of our routine ideas about emotions lack scientific evidence and that it is unclear when asking consumers to rate their emotions what kinds of data are actually being provided. A conservative and scientifically-supportable way to proceed in sensory and consumer research is to focus primarily on the measurement of core affect, namely valence and arousal, and at the same time measure important contextual and individual difference variables which have been shown to be crucial to the construction of individual emotions.","[Prescott, John] TasteMatters Res & Consulting, POB Q1150,QVB Post Off, Sydney, NSW 1230, Australia; [Prescott, John] Univ Florence, Florence, Italy","Prescott, J (reprint author), TasteMatters Res & Consulting, POB Q1150,QVB Post Off, Sydney, NSW 1230, Australia.",Prescott@taste-matters.org,"Prescott, John/D-3635-2012","Prescott, John/0000-0002-5811-9114",,,,103,7,7,0,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-3293,1873-6343,,FOOD QUAL PREFER,Food.

The research specifically focused on how immediacy and dominance impacted the relationship between leaders' delivery styles and followers' mood, perceptions of charismatic leadership, and performance. Results showed that immediate and dominant leadership behaviors were critical in eliciting positive mood and reducing negative mood in followers. In the absence of immediate and dominance behaviors in leaders, followers' negative mood increased and positive mood decreased. Moreover, the dominant and immediate displays also led to higher perceptions of charismatic leadership. Crucially, only simple or mixed dominant delivery styles led to an enhancement in the performance of followers. The mediating role of followers' positive mood on the relationship between leaders' delivery styles and followers' performance was also examined. More importantly, positive mood explained the link between leaders' delivery styles and performance.

Automatic mimicry might be implicated in empathy and affiliation and is impaired in several pathologies. Despite a growing body of literature on its phenomenology, the function and underlying mechanisms of mimicry remain poorly understood. The current review puts forward a new Neurocognitive Model of Emotional Contagion (NMEC), demonstrating how basic automatic mimicry can give rise to emotional contagion. We combine neurological, developmental and evolutionary insights to argue that automatic mimicry is a precursor to healthy social development. We show that (i) strong synchronization exists between people, (ii) that this resonates on different levels of processing and (iii) demonstrate how mimicry translates into emotional contagion. We conclude that our synthesized model, built upon integrative knowledge from various fields, provides a promising avenue for future research investigating the role of mimicry in human mental health and social development.","[Prochazkova, Eliska; Kret, Mariska E.] Leiden Univ, Inst Psychol, Cognit Psychol Unit, Wassenaarseweg 52, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands; [Prochazkova, Eliska; Kret, Mariska E.] LIBC, Albinusdreef 2, NL-2300 RC Leiden, Netherlands","Kret, ME (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Inst Psychol, Cognit Psychol Unit, Wassenaarseweg 52, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands.",e.prochazkova@fsw.leidenuniv.nl; m.e.kret@fsw.leidenuniv.nl,,"Kret, Mariska/0000-0002-3197-5084",Netherlands Science Foundation [016-155-082]; NWO (Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek) [406-15-026],Funding Research was supported by the Netherlands Science Foundation (VENI # 016-155-082) to MK and (Talent Grant # 406-15-026) from NWO (Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek) to MK and EP.,,194,19,19,4,23,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0149-7634,1873-7528,,NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV R,Neurosci.

These cravings are often related to negative affect, especially in emotional eaters. Recent studies have revived interest in a theory on the implicit modulation of affect: the facial feedback hypothesis. This theory claims that mimic expressions influence affective experiences. Given the association between negative affect and food craving, facial feedback could provide a means to reduce or prevent food cravings. In an experimental study, using a read aloud task, we examined, whether an implicit modulation of facial muscle activity - zygomatic muscle (smiling: FF+) and corrugator muscle (frowning: FF-) -would alter food cue-induced cravings in healthy young women (n = 60). We further examined, if traits in emotional eating influence the facial feedback-effect. The activation of the zygomatic muscle prevented the occurrence of food cravings after exposure with palatable food cues. Food craving only increased in the FF - group (p = 0.029). The facial feedback effect was especially pronounced in emotional eaters, indicated by a significant moderation (p = 0.041). In participants with high degrees of emotional eating, food craving was reduced in the FF + group and amplified in the FF- group. The results indicate that mimic expressions might influence food cravings on implicit pathways. Existing approaches that target implicit behavior modification via facial feedback may be transferable to eating behavior. These methods could potentially help in altering dysfunctional eating associated with food craving, especially in individuals prone to emotional eating. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In line with this, several previous studies investigated changes in bodily responses including facial expressions, heart rate or skin conductance during affective evaluation of emotional words and sentences. This study investigates the embodiment of emotional word processing from a social perspective by experimentally manipulating the emotional valence of a word and its personal reference. Stimuli consisted of pronoun-noun pairs, i.e., positive, negative, and neutral nouns paired with possessive pronouns of the first or the third person (""my,"" ""his"") or the non-referential negation term (""no"") as controls. Participants had to quickly evaluate the word pairs by key presses as either positive, negative, or neutral, depending on the subjective feelings they elicit. Hereafter, they elaborated the intensity of the feeling on a non-verbal scale from 1 (very unpleasant) to 9 (very pleasant). Facial expressions (M. Zygomaticus, M. Corrugator), heart rate, and, for exploratory purposes, skin conductance were recorded continuously during the spontaneous and elaborate evaluation tasks. Positive pronoun-noun phrases were responded to the quickest and judged more often as positive when they were self-related, i.e., related to the reader's self (e.g., ""my happiness,"" ""my joy"") than when related to the self of a virtual other (e.g., ""his happiness,"" ""his joy""), suggesting a self-positivity bias in the emotional evaluation of word stimuli. Physiologically, evaluation of emotional, unlike neutral pronoun-noun pairs initially elicited an increase in mean heart rate irrespective of stimulus reference. Changes in facial muscle activity, M. Zygomaticus in particular, were most pronounced during spontaneous evaluation of positive other-related pronoun-noun phrases in line with theoretical assumptions that facial expressions are socially embedded even in situation where no real communication partner is present. Taken together, the present results confirm and extend the embodiment hypothesis of language by showing that bodily signals can be differently pronounced during emotional evaluation of self-and other-related emotional words.","[Weis, Patrick P.; Herbert, Cornelia] Univ Tubingen, Dept Psychiat, Tubingen, Germany; [Herbert, Cornelia] Univ Ulm, Inst Psychol & Educ Appl Emot & Motivat Res, Ulm, Germany","Herbert, C (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Dept Psychiat, Tubingen, Germany.; Herbert, C (reprint author), Univ Ulm, Inst Psychol & Educ Appl Emot & Motivat Res, Ulm, Germany.",cornelia.herbert@uni-ulm.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) [HE 5880/3-1],"This study was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), grant HE 5880/3-1, awarded to CH.",,102,5,5,1,11,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

We reasoned that positive spontaneous thoughts may at least be concomitants of incentive salience, and as such, they might likewise mediate the effect of liking on wanting. In Study 1, 103 adults recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk reported on key aspects of 10 everyday activities. As predicted, positive spontaneous thoughts mediated the relationship between liking an activity in the past and wanting to engage in it in the future. In Study 2, 99 undergraduate students viewed amusing and humorless cartoons and completed a thought-listing task, providing experimental evidence for the causal effect of liking on positive spontaneous thoughts. In Study 3, we tested whether positive spontaneous thoughts play an active role in energizing wanting rather than merely co-occurring with (inferred) incentive salience. In that experiment involving 80 undergraduates, participants who were led to believe that their spontaneous thoughts about a target activity were especially positive planned to devote more time to that activity over the coming week than participants who received no such information about their spontaneous thoughts. Collectively, these findings suggest that positive spontaneous thoughts may play an important role in shaping approach motivation. Broader implications and future directions in the study of positive spontaneous thoughts are discussed.","[Rice, Elise L.; Fredrickson, Barbara L.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, 910 Raleigh Rd,POB 2688, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA","Fredrickson, BL (reprint author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, 910 Raleigh Rd,POB 2688, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA.; Rice, EL (reprint author), NCI, Behav Res Program, Div Canc Control & Populat Sci, 9609 Med Ctr Dr,3E532, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",elise.rice@nih.gov; blf@unc.edu,,,"NSF Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1144081]; National Institutes of Health [R01CA170128, R01AT007884, R01NR012899]; NIH Common Fund; Positive Psychology Science Fund at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","We thank Kristen Lindquist, Keith Payne, Paschal Sheeran, and Laura Castro-Schilo for their helpful comments on this work.

While some previous studies found evidence for facial feedback effects, recent replication attempts could not confirm these findings. Are our decisions throughout the day amenable to the state of our facial muscles? We tested the effect of smiling and frowning on the evaluation of emotional sentences describing everyday situations. While most previous studies based their assessment of awareness on verbal debriefing interviews without explicitly defined criteria, we employed a written debriefing questionnaire in order to avoid potential bias when identifying participants' awareness. Our results indicate that smiling/frowning increased/decreased sentence ratings only for participants aware of their expressions. This emphasizes the importance of more rigorous awareness tests in facial feedback studies.

Our aim in this article is to identify a basic set of principles that underlie otherwise diverse aspects of human experience at all levels of psychological reality, from neural processes to group dynamics. The core idea is that neural, behavioral, mental, and social structures emerge through the synchronization of lower-level elements (e.g., neurons, muscle movements, thoughts and feelings, individuals) into a functional unit-a coherent structure that functions to accomplish tasks. The coherence provided by the formation of functional units may be transient, persisting only as long as necessary to perform the task at hand. This creates the potential for the repeated assembly and disassembly of functional units in accordance with changing task demands. This perspective is rooted in principles of complexity science and non-linear dynamical systems and is supported by recent discoveries in neuroscience and recent models in cognitive and social psychology. We offer guidelines for investigating the emergence of functional units in different domains, thereby honoring the topical differentiation of psychology while providing an integrative foundation for the field.","[Nowak, Andrzej] SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Dept Psychol, Warsaw, Poland; [Nowak, Andrzej; Vallacher, Robin R.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Psychol, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Zochowski, Michal] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys & Biophys Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Rychwalska, Agnieszka] Univ Warsaw, Robert Zajonc Inst Social Studies, Warsaw, Poland","Nowak, A (reprint author), SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Dept Psychol, Warsaw, Poland.; Nowak, A (reprint author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Psychol, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",nowak@fau.edu,,,Polish National Science Centre [NCN 2011/03/B/HS6/05084],We acknowledge the support of the grant from Polish National Science Centre NCN 2011/03/B/HS6/05084.,,132,0,0,2,22,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Instead of viewing mind and body in opposition to each other, we advocate for a more reciprocal view in which mind and body work in conjunction. Consistent with an integrated mind-body approach, we begin our review by describing research on embodied persuasion revealing that focusing on our own body can reduce but also increase thinking (elaboration), as well as affecting the use of thoughts in forming evaluations (validation). Next, we extend our integrated view to a new domain and suggest that physical objects can influence thoughts and that one's thoughts can also be objectified. The first portion of this section focuses on research on enclothed cognition revealing that wearing physical objects can operate through the same processes of elaboration (increasing and decreasing thinking) and validation (increasing and decreasing thought usage) as the body. The second portion reveals that thoughts can be understood and treated as if they were physical objects affecting evaluative processes by influencing elaboration and validation processes. The final section provides some practical guidance relevant to campaigns designed to reduce the objectification of women and the infrahumanization of stigmatized groups.","[Brinol, Pablo] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Psychol, Campus Cantoblanco,Crta Colmenar,Km 15, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Petty, Richard E.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Belding, Jennifer] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Brinol, P (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Psychol, Campus Cantoblanco,Crta Colmenar,Km 15, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",pablo.brinnol@uam.es,"Brinol, Pablo/B-7329-2011","Brinol, Pablo/0000-0002-0327-5865",,,,73,1,1,3,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0144-6665,2044-8309,,BRIT J SOC PSYCHOL,Br.

The effect of postural power displays (i.e. power poses) on hormone levels and decision-making has recently been challenged. While Carney et al. (2010) found that holding brief postural displays of power leads to increased testosterone, decreased cortisol and greater economic risk taking, this failed to replicate in a recent high-powered study (Ranehill et al. 2015). It has been put forward that subtle differences in social context may account for the differences in results. Power displays naturally occur within the context of competitions, as do changes in hormones, and researchers have yet to examine the effects of poses within this ecologically relevant context. Using a large sample of 247 male participants, natural winners and losers of a physical competition were randomly assigned to hold a low, neutral or high-power postural display. We found no main effect of pose type on testosterone, cortisol, risk or feelings of power. Winners assigned to a high-power pose had a relative, albeit small, rise in testosterone compared to winners who held neutral or low-power poses. For losers, we found little evidence that high-power poses lead to increased testosterone relative to those holding neutral or low-powered poses. If anything, the reverse was observed losers had a reduction in testosterone after holding high-power poses. To the extent that changes in testosterone modulate social behaviors adaptively, it is possible that the relative reduction in testosterone observed in losers taking high-powered poses is designed to inhibit further ""winner-like"" behavior that could result in continued defeat and harm. Still, effects were small, multiple comparisons were made, and the results ran counter to our predictions. We thus treat these conclusions as preliminary. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

But research also shows that semantic context does more than help people bring known concepts to mind-it also teaches people new concepts. In five experiments, we show that when photos increase these feelings of learning, they also increase positive evaluations. People saw fictitious wine names and evaluated claims about each. Within subjects, wine names appeared with (or without) photos depicting the noun in the names. We found that photos promoted positive evaluations, did so most when they were most likely to help people learn new words, and even led people to think the wines tasted better.

An important prediction of these models is that disrupting simulation should make emotion recognition more difficult. Here we used electroencephalogram (EEG) and facial electromyogram (EMG) to investigate how interfering with sensorimotor signals from the face influences the real-time processing of emotional faces. EEG and EMG were recorded as healthy adults viewed emotional faces and rated their valence. During control blocks, participants held a conjoined pair of chopsticks loosely between their lips. During interference blocks, participants held the chopsticks horizontally between their teeth and lips to generate motor noise on the lower part of the face. This noise was confirmed by EMG at the zygomaticus. Analysis of EEG indicated that faces expressing happiness or disgust-lower face expressions-elicited larger amplitude N400 when they were presented during the interference than the control blocks, suggesting interference led to greater semantic retrieval demands. The selective impact of facial motor interference on the brain response to lower face expressions supports sensorimotor models of emotion understanding.","[Davis, Joshua D.; Coulson, Seana] Univ Calif San Diego, Cognit Sci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Winkielman, Piotr] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Winkielman, Piotr] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Behav Sci Grp, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Winkielman, Piotr] SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Warsaw, Poland","Davis, JD (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Cognit Sci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",jdd001@ucsd.edu,,"Winkielman, Piotr/0000-0003-2330-1802",,,,70,7,7,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1530-7026,1531-135X,,COGN AFFECT BEHAV NE,Cogn.

Participants keeping powerful poses experienced increased enjoyment, presence, and controller responsiveness compared with those holding powerless poses. Congruent with self-perception and automatic activation models, mediation analyses uncovered direct effects of power poses and also indirect effects in which power poses increased power feelings, which in turn were associated with higher enjoyment, presence, and controller responsiveness but reduced arousal. This provides initial evidence for how physical poses affect people's experiences with natural game interfaces, and highlight basic self perception and automatic activation mechanisms behind the effect.

Research has demonstrated their efficacy in a wide range of psychological conditions characterized by emotion dysregulation. Neuroimaging studies have evidenced functional and structural changes in a myriad of brain regions mainly involved in attention systems, emotion regulation, and self-referential processing. In this article we review studies on psychological and neurobiological correlates across different empirically derived models of research, including dispositional mindfulness, mindfulness induction, MBIs, and expert meditators in relation to emotion regulation. From the perspective of recent findings in the neuroscience of emotion regulation, we discuss the interplay of top-down and bottom-up emotion regulation mechanisms associated with different mindfulness models. From a phenomenological and cognitive perspective, authors have argued that mindfulness elicits a ""mindful emotion regulation"" strategy; however, from a clinical perspective, this construct has not been properly differentiated from other strategies and interventions within MBIs. In this context we propose the distinction between top-down and bottom-up mindfulness based emotion regulation strategies. Furthermore, we propose an embodied emotion regulation framework as a multilevel approach for understanding psychobiological changes due to mindfulness meditation regarding its effect on emotion regulation. Finally, based on clinical neuroscientific evidence on mindfulness, we open perspectives and dialogues regarding commonalities and differences between MBIs and other psychotherapeutic strategies for emotion regulation.","[Guendelman, Simon] Humboldt Univ, Berlin Sch Mind & Brain, Social Cognit Grp, Berlin, Germany; [Medeiros, Sebastian] Millennium Inst Res Depress & Personal, Res Unit Psychotherapeut Intervent & Change Proc, Santiago, Chile; [Medeiros, Sebastian] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Psychol, Hlth Psychol, Santiago, Chile; [Rampes, Hagen] Cent North West London Fdn NHS Fdn Trust, Community Mental Hlth Team East, London, England","Guendelman, S (reprint author), Humboldt Univ, Berlin Sch Mind & Brain, Social Cognit Grp, Berlin, Germany.",simon.guendelman@gmail.com,,,"CONICYT (National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Chile); Beca-Chile Scholarship; Berlin School of Mind and Brain, Humboldt Universitat; Fund for Innovation and Competitiveness (FIC) of the Chilean Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism, through the Millennium Scientific Initiative [IS130005]","This review paper was supported by the Fund of the following institutions: CONICYT (National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, Chile).

The ability of VC/VS DBS to evoke spontaneous mirth in patients, often accompanied by smiling and laughter, is clinically well documented. However, the neural correlates of DBS-evoked mirth remain poorly characterized. Patients undergoing VC/VS DBS surgery underwent intraoperative evaluation in which mirth-inducing and nonmirth-inducing stimulation localizations were identified. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for fMRI, the effect of mirthinducing DBS on functional and effective connectivity among established nodes in limbic cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuitry was investigated. Both mirth-inducing and non-mirth-inducing VC/VS DBS consistently resulted (conjunction, global null, family-wise error-corrected P < 0.05) in activation of amygdala, ventral striatum, and mediodorsal thalamus. However, only mirth-inducing DBS resulted in functional inhibition of anterior cingulate cortex. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that mirth-inducing DBS enhanced effective connectivity from anterior cingulate to ventral striatum, while attenuating connectivity from thalamus to ventral striatum relative to non-mirth-inducing stimulation. These results suggest that DBS-evoked mood elevation is accompanied by distinct patterns of limbic thalamocortical connectivity. Using the novel combination of DBS-evoked mood alteration and functional MRI in human subjects, we provide new insights into the networklevel mechanisms that influence affect.","[Gibson, William S.; Cho, Shinho; Min, Hoon-Ki; Lee, Kendall H.] Mayo Clin, Dept Neurol Surg, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Gorny, Krzysztof R.; Felmlee, Joel P.; Welker, Kirk M.; Min, Hoon-Ki] Mayo Clin, Dept Radiol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Klassen, Bryan T.] Mayo Clin, Dept Neurol, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Min, Hoon-Ki; Lee, Kendall H.] Mayo Clin, Dept Physiol & Biomed Engn, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Abulseoud, Osama A.] Mayo Clin, Dept Psychiat & Psychol, Rochester, MN 55906 USA; [Abulseoud, Osama A.] Natl Inst Drug Abuse, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA","Lee, KH (reprint author), Dept Neurol Surg, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.; Lee, KH (reprint author), Dept Physiol & Biomed Engn, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",min.paul@mayo.edu; Lee.Kendall@mayo.edu,"Min, Hoon-Ki/A-6025-2018","Min, Hoon-Ki/0000-0002-1084-2469",National Institutes of Health [R01 NS 70872]; The Grainger Foundation,This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01 NS 70872 awarded to K.H.L.) and by The Grainger Foundation.,,88,7,7,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1047-3211,1460-2199,,CEREB CORTEX,Cereb.

While research shows upright posture improves self-esteem and mood in healthy samples, little research has investigated this in depressed samples. This study aimed to investigate whether changing posture could reduce negative affect and fatigue in people with mild to moderate depression undergoing a stressful task. Methods: Sixty-one community participants who screened positive for mild to moderate depression were recruited into a study purportedly on the effects of physiotherapy tape on cognitive function. They were randomized to sit with usual posture or upright posture and physiotherapy tape was applied. Participants completed the Trier Social Stress Test speech task. Changes in affect and fatigue were assessed. The words spoken by the participants during their speeches were analysed. Results: At baseline, all participants had significantly more slumped posture than normative data. The postural manipulation significantly improved posture and increased high arousal positive affect and fatigue compared to usual posture. The upright group spoke significantly more words than the usual posture group, used fewer first person singular personal pronouns, but more sadness words. Upright shoulder angle was associated with lower negative affect and lower anxiety across both groups. Limitations: The experiment was only brief and a non-clinical sample was used. Conclusions: This preliminary study suggests that adopting an upright posture may increase positive affect, reduce fatigue, and decrease self-focus in people with mild-to-moderate depression. Future research should investigate postural manipulations over a longer time period and in samples with clinically diagnosed depression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent psychological frameworks have introduced the notion of rhythmic entrainment, among other mechanisms, as an emotion induction principle. In this review paper, we discuss rhythmic entrainment as an affect induction mechanism by differentiating four levels of entrainment in humans perceptual, autonomic physiological, motor, and social all of which could contribute to a subjective feeling component. We review the theoretical and empirical literature on rhythmic entrainment to music that supports the existence of these different levels of entrainment by describing the phenomena and characterizing the associated underlying brain processes. The goal of this review is to present the theoretical implications and empirical findings about rhythmic entrainment as an important principle at the basis of affect induction via music, since it rests upon the temporal dimension of music, which is a specificity of music as an affective stimulus.","[Trost, W.

Investigating the experience, behavior, and physiological correlates of affective events, such as winning and losing during a competitive game, therefore might be used to adapt the agent's emotional states and system events. An experimental virtual reality game environment was designed as a stepping stone toward a system to demonstrate affective symbiosis. Users were invited to play a game of air hockey with affective agents in virtual reality. We collected the electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, and postural data, as well as self-reports, to investigate how emotional events affected physiology, behavior, and experience. The users were found to be engaged in the competition strongly while only paying limited attention to their adversaries' emotional expressions. We discuss how game events are much stronger causes for affective responses, with the physiological effects of winning and losing becoming more enhanced as the game progresses. We discuss how an affective, symbiotic system could implement both game events and dynamic, affective agents to create a system for total immersion.","[Ahmed, Imtiaj; Harjunen, Ville; Jacucci, Giulio; Ravaja, Niklas; Spape, Michiel M.] Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci, HIIT, Helsinki, Finland; [Jacucci, Giulio] Univ Helsinki, Dept Comp Sci, HIIT, Helsinki, Finland; [Spape, Michiel M.] Liverpool Hope Univ, Dept Psychol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Ravaja, Niklas] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Coll Adv Studies, Helsinki, Finland; [Ravaja, Niklas] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Helsinki, Finland","Ahmed, I (reprint author), Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci, HIIT, Helsinki, Finland.",Imtiaj.Ahmed@helsinki.fi; Ville.Harjunen@helsinki.fi; Giulio.Jacucci@helsinki.fi; Niklas.Ravaja@aalto.fi; spapem@hope.ac.uk,"Ravaja, Niklas/D-1532-2013","Ravaja, Niklas/0000-0003-1876-8731; Ahmed, Imtiaj/0000-0001-5917-5460",Academy of Finland [268999],This work was supported by the Academy of Finland.

IET is an umbrella term which describes the impact of emotions in human-human interaction (HHI). This includes emotion contagion and social appraisal effects. These effects are particularly relevant in domains such as teaching, sports, exercise and healthy eating; domains increasingly targeted by socially assistive robotics. As such, we suggest socially assistive robots may benefit from affective communication in the same way as their human counterparts. We show that emotion recognition from robot voice and motion is possible in explicit validation experiments but does not hold in a socially assistive interaction. Our findings suggest that robot to human IET relies on the human having an expectation for, and hence recognition of, robot emotions; mimicry of valanced motion is not sufficient.","[Winkle, Katie; Bremner, Paul] Univ West England, Bristol Robot Lab, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England","Winkle, K (reprint author), Univ West England, Bristol Robot Lab, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",k.winkle@bristol.ac.uk; paul.bremner@brl.ac.uk,,,EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Autonomous and Robotic Systems (FARSCOPE) at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory,This work was supported by the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Autonomous and Robotic Systems (FARSCOPE) at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory.,,45,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1944-9445,,978-1-5386-3518-6,IEEE ROMAN,,,2017,,,,,,,627,634,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Robotics",Computer Science; Robotics,BJ7GQ,WOS:000427262400098,,,,,4/26/19

We assumed changes in roles of power on the basis of changes in visual dominance behaviour, which proved to be a reliable indicator of the social power of the individual in previous researches. Each pair conversed on predefined topics three times for three minutes. By placing individuals in a neutral or expansive posture, the purpose of which was covered by the use of a cover story, we created a difference in nonverbal expression of power between the two individuals. In the first conversation, both individuals adopted a neutral pose. In the second conversation, one individual adopted an expansive posture, while the other remained in a neutral one, and vice versa in the third conversation. Interactions were filmed with two cameras, which enabled us to analyse nonverbal behaviour. The results show that the differences in displays of power with expansive body postures between individuals are not associated with changes in visual dominance behaviour of individuals. From this we conclude that in the relations in which the social hierarchy of power is already established, the use of power poses does not help increase the power of the individual who adopts the posture.","[Jamnik, Jure; Zvelc, Gregor] Univ Primorska, Fac Math Nat Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Psychol, Koper, Slovenia; [Jamnik, Jure] Inst Clin Hypnosis Counseling & Psychol, Radovljica, Slovenia; [Zvelc, Gregor] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Arts, Dept Psychol, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Zvelc, Gregor] Inst Integrat Psychotherapy & Counselling, Ljubljana, Slovenia","Jamnik, J (reprint author), Kocna 5, SI-4274 Blejska Dobrava, Slovenia.",jure.jamnik1991@gmail.com,,,,,,37,0,0,2,9,CROATIAN INTERDISCIPLINARY SOC,SESVETE,"SIMUNCEVECKA 38B, SESVETE, HR-10360, CROATIA",1334-4684,1334-4676,,INTERDISCIP DESCR CO,Interdiscip.

This study tested for the first time whether causal and concessive connectives induce expectations of emotional continuity and discontinuity, respectively. Using a novel double-task paradigm, participants first listened to an antecedent clause with a causal or concessive connective (Because/Although the pupil studied a lot...), followed by an emotional icon (emoticon), which could match or mismatch the emotional valence of the antecedent. In Experiment 1 participants had to choose the best continuation for the antecedent clause (he passed vs. he failed the exam) and then identify the emoticon previously shown. In Experiment 2 they had to judge a perceptual feature of the emoticon before performing the consequent choice task. For causal connectives the congruence between the antecedent and the emoticon valence facilitates the consequent choice task (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2) and the emoticon recognition task (Experiment 1) but not the early perceptual judgment task (Experiment 2). This means that causal connectives promote emotional valence continuity at the stage of meaning integration processes. By contrast, concessive connectives do not induce emotional continuity expectancies. In addition, performance in causal positive antecedents and in concessive negative antecedents was more efficient than in the contrasting conditions, suggesting strong emotional biases for these connectives.","[Morera, Yurena; de Vega, Manuel] Univ La Laguna, Inst Univ Neurociencia IUNE, Dept Psicol Cognit Social & Org, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain; [Leon, Jose A.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Psicol Basica, Madrid, Spain; [Escudero, Inmaculada] UNED, Dept Psicol Evolut & Educ, Madrid, Spain","Morera, Y (reprint author), Univ La Laguna, Fac Psicol, Dept Psicol Cognit, Campus Guajara, San Cristobal la Laguna 38205, Tenerife, Spain.",ymorera@ull.es,,"Escudero, lnmaculada/0000-0003-2001-5819","Canary Agency for Research, Innovation and Information Society (NEUROCOG project); European Regional Development Fund; MINECO, Spain [PSI2013-4729-P]","This research was supported by the Canary Agency for Research, Innovation and Information Society (NEUROCOG project) and the European Regional Development Fund and funded through a grant from MINECO PSI2013-4729-P, Spain.",,34,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0163-853X,1532-6950,,DISCOURSE PROCESS,Discl.

Extending this work, the present experiments examine how stooped body posture influences recovery from pre-existing negative mood. In Experiment 1 (n = 229), participants were randomly assigned to receive either a negative or neutral mood induction, after which participants were instructed to take either a stooped, straight, or control posture while writing down their thoughts. Stooped posture (compared to straight or control postures) led to less mood recovery in the negative mood condition, and more negative mood in the neutral mood condition. Furthermore, stooped posture led to more negative thoughts overall compared to straight or control postures. In Experiment 2 (n = 122), all participants underwent a negative mood induction, after which half received cognitive reappraisal instructions and half received no instructions. Mood-congruent cognitions were assessed through autobiographical memory recall. Again, stooped (compared to straight) position led to less mood recovery. Notably, this was independent of regulation instruction.

Considering the demands of the working world, the development of the positive intervention (PI) programme was based on empirical findings and latest theoretical advances from the field of positive psychology, namely the PERMA model of well-being. The new PERMA-based programme's effectiveness to increase employee well-being was evaluated with a longitudinal field experiment, including a wait list control group and an already established PI programme (i.e., gratitude programme) for comparison (three-armed randomized controlled trial; n=303, N-male=99, N-female=203, M-age=41.16, SD=12.26). Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) supported that on average, participants of the gratitude programme and the PERMA-based programme reported significant increases in employee well-being after the intervention, as compared to no increases in the wait list control group. The significant increases yielded small effect sizes for general subjective well-being and medium effect sizes for work-related subjective well-being. Post-hoc analyses controlling for baseline well-being also supported the efficacy of the PIs. Contrary to the prediction of the PERMA-based programme's superiority, participants of both online PI programmes reported similar gains in employee well-being components. Practical implications, limitations, and future research are discussed.","[Neumeier, Lena M.; Sckopke, Philipp] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Psychol, Munich, Germany; [Brook, Libby; Ditchburn, Graeme] Murdoch Univ, Sch Psychol & Exercise Sci, Murdoch, Australia","Ditchburn, G (reprint author), Murdoch Univ, Sch Psychol & Exercise Sci, Murdoch, Australia.",Graeme.Ditchburn@murdoch.edu.au,,,,,,181,1,1,3,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1359-432X,1464-0643,,EUR J WORK ORGAN PSY,Eur.

To date the lexical decision study of Van Havermaet and Wurm (2014) is the only study to include all three of these constructs. Stimuli in the current study were black-and-white line drawings corresponding to the common nouns used by Van Havermaet and Wurm (2014). Participants viewed the stimuli one at a time in a random order and had to name them as quickly as possible. Naming times revealed a significant three-way interaction between Danger, Usefulness, and BOI similar to that found for visual lexical decision: The familiar Danger x Usefulness interaction, observed in many previous studies, was observed only for items relatively lower on BOI.

Design/methodology/approach - The distinct fields of research are critically reviewed, the proposed new integrated conceptual framework is presented and compared with other relevant theory, and finally the implications for practice and the connection with contemporary leadership development theory are explored. Findings - It is suggested that decision-makers' performance in volatile or complex environments could be enhanced through the appropriate engagement of each among the expanded set of cognitive faculties identified in the proposed model, and that a decision-making methodology incorporating prompts to engage each of these aspects of cognition could be adopted by individuals or embedded in organisational processes. Originality/value - This paper proposes a novel, integrated psychological model with potential relevance both as a conceptual framework for future research in contemporary leadership theory and as the basis for a decision-making methodology with practical application in leadership development.","[Wray, Christopher] Univ Oxford, New Coll, Phys & Philosophy, London, England; [Wray, Christopher] City Law Sch, London, England; [Wray, Christopher] Ctr Vis Developing World Charitable Fdn, London, England","Wray, C (reprint author), Univ Oxford, New Coll, Phys & Philosophy, London, England.; Wray, C (reprint author), City Law Sch, London, England.; Wray, C (reprint author), Ctr Vis Developing World Charitable Fdn, London, England.",contact@christopherwray.eu,,,,,,82,1,1,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0143-7739,1472-5347,,LEADERSHIP ORG DEV J,Leadersh.

Understanding how the bodily state of being physically active interferes with accurate risk judgments is especially important in risky activities, such as risk sports or even biking in the city. The present investigation consisted of two field studies (Study 1, N = 45; Study 2, N = 110) and one experimental study (Study 3, N = 44) examining the influence of physical activity on risk judgments. In Study 1, backcountry skiers judged risks of backcountry skiing while on tour and in Study 2 indoor climbers judged climbing risks. In Study 3, participants were riding on a stationary bicycle in the laboratory and judged risks related and unrelated to that activity. It was found that physical activity can decrease the perceived likelihood of risks, both related and unrelated to the activity, and that this effect is moderated by experience.","[Raue, Martina; Streicher, Bernhard; Lermer, Eva; Frey, Dieter] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Dept Psychol, Munich, Germany; [Streicher, Bernhard] Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol UMIT, Dept Psychol Med Sci & Hlth Syst Management, Hall In Tirol, Austria","Raue, M (reprint author), Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Dept Psychol, Munich, Germany.",martina.raue@psy.lmu.de,"Streicher, Bernhard/B-8739-2016","Streicher, Bernhard/0000-0003-2964-6393",,,,57,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-9877,1466-4461,,J RISK RES,J.

The embodied cognition approach involves a new cognitive revolution that criticizes those assumptions, while defending an embodied mind that is implicit in nature, but also enactive, embedded and extended through cultural mechanisms. This paper assumes this approach, which requires a new design of learning environments that are based on that bodily experience, are situated and have strong emotional content. However, it also asserts that learning from the body will be insufficient if we cannot go beyond that, promoting the explicitation of these embodied and implicit representations through representational suppression, suspension and redescription processes mediated by different types of external representations. However, explicitation also requires implicitation processes, without which the incorporation of acquired knowledge into the embodied mind would not be possible.","[Pozo, Juan-Ignacio] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain","Pozo, JI (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Psicol, Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",nacho.pozo@uam.es,"Pozo, Juan/B-7575-2011","Pozo, Juan/0000-0002-5722-1379","Spanish Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad [EDU2013-47593-C2-1-P]","This work is part of the Research Project 'Conceptions and Uses of External Representations in Learning and Teaching', funded by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad within the Convocatoria de Proyectos i+d Excelencia (EDU2013-47593-C2-1-P), of which the author is the principal researcher.

Building on the stimulus-organism-response framework and theories of emotional contagion and feelings-as-information, the main hypothesis was that a smiling (vs non-smiling) employee significantly increases customer satisfaction through the mediating influence of pleasure. Design/methodology/approach - The study used a quasi-experimental two-group between-subjects design. A total of 210 customers at a large retail bank had a brief service encounter at the store entrance with a smiling (vs non-smiling) bank teller. Customers then went into the bank to do what they came to do. Before leaving the bank, customers completed a survey that included demographic information, affect (pleasure, arousal, and dominance), and measures of customer satisfaction. Findings - A smiling (vs non-smiling) employee had a significant positive impact on customer satisfaction. This effect was mediated by pleasure, but also, to a weaker extent, by dominance. These results contradict previous claims that smiling-induced emotional contagion does not remain throughout the completion of a service encounter. Practical implications - Managers should encourage, and potentially train, employees to act in ways associated with positive emotions. Managers could also hire employees based on how good they are at acting and expressing themselves in a genuinely positive manner and create a pleasant store atmosphere so that the feelings and behaviors displayed by frontline employees are genuine rather than inauthentic. Originality/value - This is the first experimental field study to examine the isolated effect that employee-displayed smiling has on customers' affective states and satisfaction. The results provide more direct evidence for the psychological processes justified by emotional contagion and feelings-as-information theories. Furthermore, the finding that dominance mediates the smiling-satisfaction link has never been shown before.","[Otterbring, Tobias] Karlstad Univ, Dept Psychol, Serv Res Ctr, Karlstad, Sweden; [Otterbring, Tobias] Karlstad Univ, CTF, Serv Res Ctr, Karlstad, Sweden; [Otterbring, Tobias] Aarhus Univ, Dept Management, MAPP, Aarhus, Denmark","Otterbring, T (reprint author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Psychol, Serv Res Ctr, Karlstad, Sweden.; Otterbring, T (reprint author), Karlstad Univ, CTF, Serv Res Ctr, Karlstad, Sweden.; Otterbring, T (reprint author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Management, MAPP, Aarhus, Denmark.",tobias.otterbring@kau.se,,,,,,95,4,4,4,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1757-5818,1757-5826,,J SERV MANAGE,J.

It has been suggested that this helps provide social glue between affiliated people but it could also aid recognition of emotions through embodied cognition. The degree of facial mimicry, however, varies between individuals and is limited in people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). The present study sought to investigate the effect of promoting facial mimicry during a facial-emotion-recognition test. In two experiments, participants without an ASC diagnosis had their autism quotient (AQ) measured. Following a baseline test, they did an emotion-recognition test again but half of the participants were asked to mimic the target face they saw prior to making their responses. Mimicry improved emotion recognition, and further analysis revealed that the largest improvement was for participants who had higher scores on the autism traits. In fact, recognition performance was best overall for people who had high AQ scores but also received the instruction to mimic. Implications for people with ASC are explored.","[Lewis, Michael B.; Dunn, Emily] Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales; [Dunn, Emily] Univ Birmingham, Sch Psychol, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Lewis, MB (reprint author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Psychol, Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3AT, S Glam, Wales.",lewismb@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Lewis, Michael/0000-0002-5735-5318",,,,46,1,1,3,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1747-0218,1747-0226,,Q J EXP PSYCHOL,Q.

Although only a few studies have been conducted on this phenomenon with children, it is to be expected that the strength of the link between facial expression and emotional experience will diminish with age, and consequently, that the facial feedback effect will decrease with age. In order to test this hypothesis, we used an emotional induction paradigm (based on funny video-clips) with an expressive change paradigm (i.e., free expression vs. laughter restriction vs. laughter exaggeration). The emotional experience of 4-10-year-old children was assessed a posteriori based on analyses of their narratives about the video-clips. Results indicated that the children benefited from a facial feedback effect on their emotional experiences without an age effect.

This study aimed to build a model of Dance/Movement Therapy for resilience-building in people with chronic pain. Methods: A mixed methods study was conducted to test and refine a preliminary model towards building a composite model of DMT for pain resilience. Twenty-two people with chronic pain participated in a 10-week group DMT intervention. Quantitative assessments of resilience, kinesiophobia, body awareness, pain, mood, stress, and relaxation were conducted. Qualitative data were collected and analyzed according to grounded theory method and compared with the quantitative findings. Results: DMT resulted in statistically significant improvements in resilience (p < 0.001), kinesiophobia (p = 0.03), body awareness (p = 0.02), and pain intensity (p = 0.03) over time. Sixty eight percent of people felt 'moderately to a great deal better' post intervention. We found significant within-session changes in mood, stress, relaxation, and pain (p < 0.001). Key mechanisms (activating self-agency, connecting to self, connecting to others, enhancing emotional intelligence, and reframing), intervening factors and contextual conditions were identified. Based on the findings, the preliminary model was revised and refined to construct a final model. Conclusions: Group DMT is a promising treatment for chronic pain through dynamic mind-body pathways. The quantitative findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and the lack of control group. More substantive and methodological work is required such as utilization of a large scale randomized controlled trial and mediation analysis is needed to further refine the model.

Here we tested whether empathy modulates action-embodiment, hypothesizing that restricting imitation abilities will impair performance in a hand gesture comprehension task. Moreover, we hypothesized that empathy levels will modulate the imitation restriction effect. One hundred twenty participants with a range of empathy scores performed gesture comprehension under restricted and unrestricted hand conditions. Empathetic participants performed better under the unrestricted compared to the restricted condition, and compared to the low empathy participants. Remarkably however, the latter showed the exactly opposite pattern and performed better under the restricted condition. This pattern was not found in a facial expression recognition task. The selective interaction of embodiment restriction and empathy suggests that empathy modulates the way people employ embodiment in gesture comprehension. We discuss the potential of embodiment-induced therapy to improve empathetic abilities in individuals with low empathy.","[Jospe, Karine; Lavidor, Michal] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Psychol, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Jospe, Karine; Lavidor, Michal] Bar Ilan Univ, Gonda Brain Res Ctr, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Floeel, Agnes] Charite, Dept Neurol, Berlin, Germany","Jospe, K (reprint author), Bar Ilan Univ, Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Res Ctr, Dept Psychol, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.",KarineJospe@gmail.com,"Floel, Agnes/A-9426-2017",,German-Israel Foundation [I-1299-105.4/2015],This study was supported by the German-Israel Foundation Grant No. I-1299-105.4/2015.,,25,1,1,2,7,HOGREFE & HUBER PUBLISHERS,GOTTINGEN,"MERKELSTR 3, D-37085 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY",1618-3169,2190-5142,,EXP PSYCHOL,Exp.

These words were labelled as names for various objects. For objects the use of which entails ingestive oral actions (lemonade and mouthwash) inward words were preferred over outward words. For objects that trigger expectorative oral actions (toxical chemical, pill, and bubble gum) this preference was attenuated or even reversed (outward words were liked more than inward).

Here, for the first time, we have shown that the consumption of specific food substances is not only able to induce particular emotional states, but more importantly, to facilitate recognition of corresponding emotional facial expressions in others. Participants were asked to perform an emotion recognition task before and after eating either a piece of chocolate or a small amount of fish sauce-which we expected to induce happiness or disgust, respectively. Our results showed that being in a specific emotional state improves recognition of the corresponding emotional facial expression. Indeed, eating chocolate improved recognition of happy faces, while disgusted expressions were more readily recognized after eating fish sauce. In line with the embodied account of emotion understanding, we suggest that people are better at inferring the emotional state of others when their own emotional state resonates with the observed one.","[Pandolfi, Elisa; Sacripante, Riccardo; Cardini, Flavia] Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, England","Cardini, F (reprint author), Anglia Ruskin Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, England.",flavia.cardini@anglia.ac.uk,,"Cardini, Flavia/0000-0003-4301-611X",,,,44,1,1,1,21,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,14-Dec,2016,11,12,,,,,,,e0167462,10.1371/journal.pone.0167462,,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,EI8KC,WOS:000392754300030,27973559,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,4/26/19

Their antecedents and consequences have been explored frequently using semantic priming, in keeping with early models of memory representation as a semantic network of concept nodes. Contrary to what these models would predict, sensorimotor experiences in multiple modalities have proven capable of activating abstract constructs, even if they are no more than metaphorically related. In this paper, I review illustrative evidence for multimodal priming of abstract constructs through embodied metaphors. This work has implications for debates about the activation of mental content and the form of mental representation. It also highlights the need to address several thorny issues for theoretical advances.","[Lee, Spike W.

It is often assumed that attempting to recall information from memory should facilitate-or at least not disrupt-memory-based comparisons. Using the domain of price comparisons, the authors demonstrate that memory-based price comparisons are less accurate when consumers first attempt to recall the past price versus when they do not try to do so. Attempting-and failing at-explicit price recall focuses attention on metacognitive experience, resulting in a feeling-of-not-knowing, which then blocks the implicit memory that people could otherwise use to make accurate price comparisons. Drawing attention to this metacognitive feeling-of-not-knowing increases the blocking effect of recall on implicit memory, whereas drawing attention away from the feeling reduces the blocking effect. The results identify a new type of memory blocking-metacognitive memory blocking-in which the feeling-of-not-knowing blocks implicit memory during judgments. They also provide further evidence of dual representations of price memory and demonstrate that most memory-based price comparisons are based on implicit memory and do not entail explicit recall of the reference price.","[Kyung, Ellie J.] Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business, Business Adm, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Thomas, Manoj] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Mkt, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Kyung, EJ (reprint author), Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business, Business Adm, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",ellie.kyung@tuck.dartmouth.edu; manojthomas@cornell.edu,,,,,,69,1,1,1,29,AMER MARKETING ASSOC,CHICAGO,"311S WACKER DR, STE 5800, CHICAGO, IL 60606-6629 USA",0022-2437,1547-7193,,J MARKETING RES,J.

Psychological research has repeatedly shown that unconsciously contracting muscles that are usually used to smile can intensify and even elicit positive feelings (known as facial feedback). Empirical evidence also suggests that a smiling person is favourably judged by others with respect to attractiveness and trustworthiness. AimThis study's purpose was to investigate how an induced muscle contraction, similar to that of a smile, affects physicians' interactions with a standardised patient. It was expected that the smile intervention' would affect physicians' and patients' perceptions, resulting in higher ratings of the friendliness and attractiveness of physicians in the intervention group. MethodsTwenty physicians participated in the randomised controlled study (10 male, 10 female). Physicians were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: an intervention group (performing an easy cognitive task while smiling; n=11) or a control group (performing an easy cognitive task without smiling; n=9). Afterwards, physicians had a 5-minute consultation with a standardised patient. This consultation was subsequently rated by physicians, the patient and an external rater using 10-point Likert scales. ResultsPhysicians in the intervention group were rated as significantly friendlier by the external rater (mean 7.81 versus 7.11; p=0.097, (2)=0.15). In addition, physicians in the intervention group rated the patient as significantly more attractive (mean 6.91 versus 4.78; p=0.017; (2)=0.28). ConclusionsOur results suggest that physicians can influence their friendliness and their perception of patients' attractiveness. Thereby the power of pen' can be an efficient method for making the hospital a friendlier place.

Many researchers believe that the experienced bodily states (i.e., embodied experiences) should be an important factor that affects concepts' learning and use, and metaphorical mappings between abstract concepts, such as TIME and POWER, and concrete concepts, such as SPATIAL ORIENTATION, STRUCTURED EXPERIENCEs, etc., suggest the abstract-concrete concepts' connections. In most of the recent literature, we can find common elements (e.g., concrete concepts) shared by different abstract-concrete metaphorical expressions. Therefore, we assumed that mappings might also be found between two abstract concepts that share common elements, though they have no symbolic connections. In the present study, two lexical decision tasks were arranged and the priming effect between TIME and ABSTRACT ACTIONs was used as an index to test our hypothesis. Results showed a robust priming effect when a target verb and its prime belonged to the same duration type (TIME consistent condition). These findings suggest that mapping between concepts was affected by common elements. We propose a dynamic model in which mappings between concepts are influenced by common elements, including symbolic or embodied information.

In recent years, an alternative hypothesis to explain the symptoms of OCD was suggested - the 'habit-driven' hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, compulsions are the result of aberrant dysregulation of stimulus-response habit learning and obsessions are post hoc rationalizations of otherwise unexplained compulsive behaviors. In this article, we describe this hypothesis and briefly review data presented to support it. Next, we raise four questions about this hypothesis to explore how it fits the complex phenotype of OCD: (i) What are the deficits in the goal-directed system in OCD? (ii) How should we define and measure habits in humans? (iii) Are compulsions habits in the technical sense? and (iv) Are obsessions caused by compulsions? We conclude that how an imbalance in goal-directed versus habit behaviors might contribute to the complex phenotype of OCD is yet to be revealed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants were not asked to reason but instead rated the sentences for liking (Experiment 1) and physical brightness (Experiments 2-3). Sentences that followed logically from preceding sentences were judged to be more likable and brighter. Two other factors thought to be linked to implicit processing-sentence believability and facial expression-had similar effects on liking and brightness ratings.

Afterward, participants played a hypothetical ultimatum game, made a gambling decision, and reported how powerful and in charge they felt. Neither body posture nor eye gaze influenced the gambling decision, and contrary to the predictions, adopting an expansive pose reduced feelings of power.

However, our understanding of the importance of temporal dimensions of social motor synchrony in social dysfunction is limited. Here, we used a pendulum coordination paradigm to assess dynamic, process-oriented measures of social motor synchrony in adolescents with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our data indicate that adolescents with ASD demonstrate less synchronization in both spontaneous and intentional interpersonal coordination. Coupled oscillator modeling suggests that ASD participants assembled a synchronization dynamic with a weaker coupling strength, which corresponds to a lower sensitivity and decreased attention to the movements of the other person, but do not demonstrate evidence of a delay in information transmission.

However, the role of emotion regulation and bodily expression in resisting persuasion is so far underexplored. This is a surprising observation if one considers that at least 40% of advertisements use positive emotions (i.e., happiness) to persuade people to like the ad, brand, and product (Weinberger et al., 1995). In this article we present a framework in which we apply previous knowledge and theories on emotion regulation and embodiment to the process of resistance to persuasion. In doing so, we specifically address the role of facial expression in the course of resistance. The literature and findings from our own research lead us to propose that people can resist persuasion by controlling their facial expression of emotion when exposed to an advertisement. Controlling the expression of emotions elicited by an ad (for example refusing to smile) might be a fruitful way to resist the ad's persuasive potential. Moreover, we argue that co-viewers can affect embodied resistance to persuasion. Showing the viability of embodied resistance to persuasion is relevant in view of the fact that ads trying to persuade us by addressing our positive emotions are ubiquitous. Embodied resistance might help people to cope with these induced positive emotions in order to resist advertisements and might therefore work as a novel and effective strategy to resist persuasion.","[Lewinski, Peter; Fransen, Marieke L.; Tan, Ed S.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lewinski, Peter] Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland; [Tan, Ed S.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Media Cognit & Commun, Copenhagen, Denmark","Lewinski, P (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Lewinski, P (reprint author), Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland.",plewinski@kozminski.edu.pl,,"Tan, Ed/0000-0002-3848-9628",People Program (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Program [290255],The research leading to these results has received funding from the People Program (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Program FP7/2007-2013/ under REA grant agreement 290255.,,88,1,1,4,51,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Based in an embodied approach of cognition, several studies have highlighted affective stimulus-response congruency effect in healthy subjects that show a direct link between the perception of emotion and associated motor responses. This study investigated whether the categorization of emotional words involves an automatic sensorimotor simulation of approach and avoidance behaviors. We asked 28 subjects with schizophrenia and 28 controls to execute arm movements of approach or avoidance to categorize emotional words, according to their valence (positive or negative). Controls were faster to respond to a positive stimulus with a movement of approach and a negative stimulus with a movement of avoidance (congruent condition) than to perform the inverted response movements (incongruent condition). However, responses of patients with schizophrenia did not differ according to congruence condition. Our results support the apparent non-involvement of covert sensorimotor simulation of approach and avoidance in the categorization of emotional stimuli by patients with schizophrenia, despite their understanding of the emotional valence of words. This absence of affective stimulus-response compatibility effect would imply a decoupling between emotional and bodily states in patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although a clear answer has still not been found for this question, several studies suggest that processes of mental simulation of action perception loops are likely to be executed in our brain and are dependent on internal body representations. Therefore, the capability to re-enact sensorimotor experience might represent a key mechanism behind the implementation of higher cognitive capabilities, such as behavior recognition, arbitration and imitation, sense of agency, and self other distinction. This work is mainly addressed to researchers in autonomous motor and mental development for artificial agents. In particular, it aims at gathering the latest developments in the studies on exploration behaviors, internal body representations, and processes of sensorimotor simulations. Relevant studies in human and animal sciences are discussed and a parallel to similar investigations in robotics is presented.","[Schillaci, Guido; Hafner, Verona V.] Humboldt Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Adapt Syst Grp, Berlin, Germany; [Lara, Bruno] Univ Autonoma Estado Morelos, Ctr Sci Res, Cognit Robot Grp, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico","Schillaci, G (reprint author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Adapt Syst Grp, Berlin, Germany.",guido.schillaci@informatik.hu-berlin.de,,,European Union [609465],The present work has been conducted as part of the EARS (Embodied Audition for RobotS) Project.

Mimicry as an automatic imitation of a partner's behavior (this is known as ""social glue"") connects people (Miles et al., 2010). Empirical findings have confirmed that mimicry leads to favorable treatment of the mimicker (Van Baaren et al., 2003). The mechanism is reciprocal: the mimicker is more positively inclined towards the person mimicked (Chartrand and Bargh, 1999). Mimicry increases the sense of interpersonal closeness, reciprocal similarity, and facilitates the flow of interaction and helping behavior (Stel et al., 2008). At the same time, results point to a spontaneous inhibition of mimicry in the contact with members of negatively stereotyped groups (Bourgeois and Hess, 2008). So than, there are reasons to believe that purposeful activation of mimicry may reduce manifestations of negative attitudes towards others, i.e., infra humanization. It was expected that imitating a model shown on video would lower the level of infra-humanization, i.e., perceiving another individual as less capable than the Self of experiencing exclusively human (secondary) emotions. The study sample consisted of 117 female students. The study followed an experimental design and was conducted individually. It employed questionnaires and a purpose-made video recording showing a model whose facial expressions were to be mimicked by the participants. The results confirmed the predictions. Mimicking facial expressions reduced the level of infra humanization compared to the no mimicking and control conditions [F(2,114) = 3.39, p = 0.037, eta(2) = 0.06].","[Szuster, Anna; Wojnarowska, Agnieszka] Warsaw Univ, Fac Psychol, Warsaw, Poland","Szuster, A; Wojnarowska, A (reprint author), Warsaw Univ, Fac Psychol, Warsaw, Poland.",hanka@psych.uw.edu.pl; awojnarowska@psych.uw.edu.pl,,,Faculty of Psychology [BST 161506/2011]; Czech Science Foundation [407/11/0380],Funding for the study was provided by the Faculty of Psychology - BST 161506/2011 and grant Prosocial behavior and its personality aspects in the context of volunteering - Czech Science Foundation - 407/11/0380.

Functionally, emotions help address environmental uncertainty by constraining the body to support adaptive responses and social coordination. We propose emotions provide a similar function in language processing by constraining the mental simulation of language content to facilitate comprehension, and to foster alignment of mental states in message recipients. Consequently, we predicted that emotion-inducing language should be found in speeches specifically designed to create audience alignment - stump speeches of United States presidential candidates. We focused on phrases in the past imperfective verb aspect (""a bad economy was burdening us"") that leave a mental simulation of the language content open-ended, and thus unconstrained, relative to past perfective sentences (""we were burdened by a bad economy""). As predicted, imperfective phrases appeared more frequently in stump versus comparison speeches, relative to perfective phrases. In a subsequent experiment, participants rated phrases from presidential speeches as more emotionally intense when written in the imperfective aspect compared to the same phrases written in the perfective aspect, particularly for sentences perceived as negative in valence. These findings are consistent with the notion that emotions have a role in constraining the comprehension of language, a role that may be used in communication with large audiences.","[Havas, David A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA; [Chapp, Christopher B.] St Olaf Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Northfield, MN 55057 USA","Havas, DA (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA.",havasd@uww.edu,,,,,,47,0,0,5,22,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

This study demonstrated how VR could be used to examine the possible ways that systems of the body (e.g., visual, motor) may interact to influence cognition.

We use self-report data to measure team emotions, and validate results with psychophysiological data. We find that declines in performance increase the likelihood that teams decide to explore new routines rather than exploit existing ones. We also find a marginal positive effect of positive emotions, as measured by both self-report and psychophysiological data, on team decisions to explore a new routine. Further, teams successful at implementing new routines report increased positive emotions, as measured by the self-report data. This relationship is fully mediated by performance change.

We then used this virtual enfacement illusion to study whether enfacing a virtual face would also involve adopting the emotion that this face is expressing. As predicted, participants adopted the expressed emotion, as indicated by higher valence scores and better performance in a mood sensitive divergent-thinking task when facing a happy virtual face, if the virtual face moved in synchrony with their own head movements.

Because pronunciation of the [A""] sound requires a facial movement that mimics a smile particularly when the sound occurs at the end of a name, our research complements previous findings generated by the theory of embodied cognition in which biting on a pencil or chopstick evoked behavioral and mood changes. Study 1 finds that participants are more likely to help someone whose name ends with the [A""] sound while study 2 utilizes a broader set of contrasting sounds and finds a basic preference for the [A""] sound that is specific to women. Study 3 shows that women are significantly more likely to recall addressing their parents as Mommy or Daddy when soliciting help rather than Mom or Dad. Our findings complement previous research concerning motherese and highlight a phonetic cue for prosocial behavior that appears to offer insights for marketing and management.

Therefore, we conducted two behavioral experiments to examine gender differences in emotional perception in response to facial expressions (sad, neutral, and happy) under three conditions: (1) holding a pen using only the teeth (HPT), which facilitates the muscles typically associated with smiling; (2) holding a pen using only the lips (HPL), which inhibits the muscles typically associated with smiling; and (3) a control condition - hold no pen (HNP). We found that HPT made the emotional feelings more positive, and that the change degree of female's ratings of sad facial expressions between conditions (HPL to HPT) was larger than males'.

Two of the most persuasive theoretical accounts propose RFRs to rely either on motor resonance mechanisms or on more complex mechanisms involving affective processes. Previous studies demonstrated that presentation of facial and bodily expressions can generate rapid changes in adult and school-age children's muscle activity. However, to date there is little to no evidence to suggest the existence of emotional RFRs from infancy to preschool age. To investigate whether RFRs are driven by motor mimicry or could also be a result of emotional appraisal processes, we recorded facial electromyographic (EMG) activation from the zygomaticus major and frontalis medialis muscles to presentation of static facial and bodily expressions of emotions (i.e., happiness, anger, fear, and neutral) in 3-year-old children. Results showed no specific EMG activation in response to bodily emotion expressions. However, observing others' happy faces led to increased activation of the zygomaticus major and decreased activation of the frontalis medialis, whereas observing others' angry faces elicited the opposite pattern of activation. This study suggests that RFRs are the result of complex mechanisms in which both affective processes and motor resonance may play an important role. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We test the prediction, based on evolutionary psychology, that negative, threat-related emotions transfer more automatically than positive emotions. We introduce a new paradigm for investigating emotional contagion where participants are exposed to videos of faces that morph from neutral to angry or happy expressions. Participants watched these videos under high or low cognitive load. Participants reported more happiness in the happy condition than the anger condition and more anger in the anger condition than the happy condition, supporting our new paradigm. Participants in the happy condition were significantly happier under low compared with high load.

The distribution of emotionally pleasant phonemes such as long e (i), l, v, and th () indicated the presence of a (likely original) poem with a pleasant ending where the albatross drops from the mariner's neck. Three episodes of threat and escape were probably added to the albatross episode later, along with an unhappy ending. Significant differences in the proportion of pleasant phonemes employed in various sections support these conclusions.","[Whissell, Cynthia] Laurentian Univ, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada","Whissell, C (reprint author), Laurentian Univ, Dept Psychol, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada.",CWhissell@Laurentian.ca,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0033-2941,1558-691X,,PSYCHOL REP,Psychol.

The current research investigated mood congruity effects in story recall using an embodied approach to mood induction involving a facial manipulation task with 3- and 4-year-old children. Participants held a chopstick or a popsicle stick in their mouths in a way to either produce or inhibit a smile while they listened to a story featuring happy events for a happy character and sad events for a sad character. Children's mood ratings before and after mood induction indicated that mood became more positive in the smile condition, with no change in the no smile condition. Children in the smile condition, but not in the no smile condition, remembered more about the happy character than the sad character in the story. These results extend mood congruity effects to 3- and 4-year olds, suggesting that at this age representations of emotion interact with basic memory processes. Moreover, the efficacy of reenactment of sensorimotor components of emotion in modifying mood is consistent with embodied representation of emotion during early childhood. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

By modulating expressions, reappraising feelings, and redirecting attention, they can regulate their emotional experience. These findings have contributed to a blurring of the traditional boundaries between cognitive and emotional processes, and it has been suggested that emotional signals are produced in a goal-directed way and monitored for errors like other intentional actions. However, this interesting possibility has never been experimentally tested. To this end, we created a digital audio platform to covertly modify the emotional tone of participants' voices while they talked in the direction of happiness, sadness, or fear. The result showed that the audio transformations were being perceived as natural examples of the intended emotions, but the great majority of the participants, nevertheless, remained unaware that their own voices were being manipulated. This finding indicates that people are not continuously monitoring their own voice to make sure that it meets a predetermined emotional target. Instead, as a consequence of listening to their altered voices, the emotional state of the participants changed in congruence with the emotion portrayed, which was measured by both self-report and skin conductance level. This change is the first evidence, to our knowledge, of peripheral feedback effects on emotional experience in the auditory domain. As such, our result reinforces the wider framework of self-perception theory: that we often use the same inferential strategies to understand ourselves as those that we use to understand others.","[Aucouturier, Jean-Julien] Univ Paris 06, IRCAM, CNRS, STMS,UMR9912, F-74005 Paris, France; [Johansson, Petter; Hall, Lars] Lund Univ, Lund Univ Cognit Sci, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Johansson, Petter] Uppsala Univ, Swedish Coll Adv Study, S-75238 Uppsala, Sweden; [Segnini, Rodrigo] Siemens Healthcare, Tokyo 1418644, Japan; [Mercadie, Lolita] Nippon Telegraph & Tel NTT Corp, Commun Sci Labs, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2430198, Japan; [Mercadie, Lolita] Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, LEAD, UMR5022, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Watanabe, Katsumi] Waseda Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Intermedia Art & Sci, Tokyo 1698555, Japan; [Watanabe, Katsumi] Univ Tokyo, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Tokyo 1538904, Japan","Aucouturier, JJ (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, IRCAM, CNRS, STMS,UMR9912, F-74005 Paris, France.",aucouturier@gmail.com,,"Aucouturier, Jean-Julien/0000-0002-4477-4812","Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Japanese Science and Technology (JST) ERATO Implicit Brain Function Project; JST CREST Project; European Research Council [StG-335536 CREAM]; Foundation of the Association de Prevoyance Interprofessionnelle des Cadres et Ingenieurs de la region Lyonnaise (APICIL); Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation; Swedish Research Council [2014-1371, 2011-1795]; Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation [P13-1059:1]","J.-J.A. acknowledges the assistance of M.

I call the claim that there is a distinct pattern of bodily reactions that is constitutive for an emotion type the essential-ingredient view. I discuss some of the famous objections that cognitivists have raised against the feeling theory and characterize the position that cognitivist accounts take with regard to bodily reactions in emotions as the coincidental-by-product view. With regard to current empirical research from psychophysiology I argue that the coincidental-byproduct view and the essential-ingredient view are both untenable. Yet the Jamesian view can be understood in a broader context as not aiming to find essential ingredients of emotions but rather taking the bodily arousal to be part of an organisms preparing for action. A reinterpretation of James in this manner has already been presented by John Dewey, who also provides a broader framework to think of emotion and perception as being co-constituted by action-tendencies.",,,,,,,,,51,1,1,0,0,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1868-8144,,978-3-11-048023-8; 978-3-11-047889-1,HUMANPROJEKT-INTERDI,,,2016,14,,,,,,269,288,,,10.1515/9783110480238,,,20,Philosophy,Philosophy,BH6FC,WOS:000401750900014,,,,,4/26/19

This review considers behavioral, neuroscientific, and cognitive research associating movements of the body with emotive responses. Facial and bodily feedback theories of emotion have suggested that subjective reactions and outward expressions of emotions may be bidirectional; in particular, manipulated outward expressions of emotion may also trigger subjective emotional reactions. In addition, manipulated postures and facial expressions have been shown to influence physiological responses associated with emotion and motivation, such as skin conductance, heart rate, and blood temperature. More recent evidence suggests that manipulated bodily states influence prefrontal cortical activation measured with electroencephalography-which has been associated with the motivational direction of emotional states. Furthermore, bodily manipulations influence neurophysiological correlates of motivated attention and defensive reflexes. Bodily manipulations also influence the broadening and narrowing of attentional scope, which has been associated with motivational intensity. Finally, postural manipulations influence cognitive processes, such as dissonance reduction. This research, therefore, suggests that outward expressions of emotive states play a pivotal role in our emotive responses.","[Harmon-Jones, E.] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Harmon-Jones, E (reprint author), Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",eddiehj@gmail.com,,,,,,113,1,1,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2215-0919,,978-0-12-804740-8,ADV MOTIV SCI,,,2016,3,,,,,,81,111,,10.1016/bs.adms.2015.12.002,,,,31,"Psychology, Experimental; Psychology, Social",Psychology,BI0TP,WOS:000405167300003,,,,,4/26/19

Social (or Sociable) robots are designed to interact with people in a natural, interpersonal manner -often to achieve positive outcomes in diverse applications such as education, health, quality of life, entertainment, communication, and tasks requiring collaborative teamwork. The long-term goal of creating social robots that are competent and capable partners for people is quite a challenging task. They will need to be able to communicate naturally with people using both verbal and nonverbal signals. They will need to engage us not only on a cognitive level, but on an emotional level as well in order to provide effective social and task-related support to people. They will need a wide range of socialcognitive skills and a theory of other minds to understand human behavior, and to be intuitively understood by people. A deep understanding of human intelligence and behavior across multiple dimensions (i.e., cognitive, affective, physical, social, etc.) is necessary in order to design robots that can successfully play a beneficial role in the daily lives of people. This requires a multidisciplinary approach where the design of social robot technologies and methodologies are informed by robotics, artificial intelligence, psychology, neuroscience, human factors, design, anthropology, and more.","[Breazeal, Cynthia] MIT Media Lab, Personal Robots Grp, 20 Ames St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Dautenhahn, Kerstin] Univ Hertfordshire, Sch Comp Sci, Coll Lane, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England; [Kanda, Takayuki] Adv Telecommun Res ATR Inst Int, Intelligent Robot & Commun Labs, 2-2-2 Hikaridai, Kyoto 6190288, Japan","Breazeal, C (reprint author), MIT Media Lab, Personal Robots Grp, 20 Ames St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",cynthiab@media.mit.edu; k.dautenhahn@herts.ac.uk; kanda@atr.jp,,,,,,282,11,11,2,9,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-319-32552-1; 978-3-319-32550-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,1935,1971,,,10.1007/978-3-319-32552-1,,,37,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Robotics",Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Robotics,BG4HU,WOS:000388837200085,,,,,4/26/19

Results suggest that shape parameters are correlated to the positive or negative character of an emotion, while parameters related to movement are correlated with arousal level. In several cases, symbolic shape expressions based on clear visual metaphors were used. Results from our second experiment suggest participants were able to recognize emotions given a shape with a good accuracy within 28% of the dimensions of the Circumplex Model. We conclude that shape and shape changes of a 2D flexible surface indeed appear able to convey emotions in a way that is worthy of future exploration.","[Strohmeier, Paul; Carrascal, Juan Pablo; Meban, Margaret; Vertegaal, Roel] Queens Univ, Human Media Lab, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Cheng, Bernard] Queens Univ, EQUIS Lab, Kingston, ON, Canada","Strohmeier, P (reprint author), Queens Univ, Human Media Lab, Kingston, ON, Canada.",,"Carrascal, Juan Pablo/K-9851-2017; Strohmeier, Paul/M-5546-2016","Carrascal, Juan Pablo/0000-0002-9028-8161; Strohmeier, Paul/0000-0002-7442-2607",,,,57,5,5,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3362-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,3781,3792,,10.1145/2858036.2858537,,,,12,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BF3EQ,WOS:000380532903072,,,,,4/26/19

We conclude that the influence of leader affective displays can be understood through the mediation paths of emotional contagion and cognitive interpretation of affect in combination with the first- and second-stage moderators of these paths. We also conclude that the common yet overly simplistic notion that leader displays of positive affect are more effective than leader displays of negative affect can in important part be attributed to an overreliance on subjective ratings as indicators of leadership effectiveness, whereas behavioral indicators of leadership effectiveness suggest a more contingent view of the effectiveness of positive and negative affective displays. We propose that to bolster and further develop these conclusions, we need (a) more research focusing on moderation in dual-path mediation; (b) development of theory about cognitive interpretations following leader affective displays; and (c) more sophisticated models of the difference amongst different affective states to better capture the complexity of their effects. We also outline how evidence regarding the role of follower affect in response to leadership more generally points to the potential for integration of affective and non-affective models of leadership.","[van Knippenberg, Daan] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Kleef, Gerben A.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands","van Knippenberg, D (reprint author), Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",dvanknippenberg@rsm.nl,,"Van Knippenberg, Daniel L/0000-0002-0269-8102",,,,120,12,12,11,84,ACAD MANAGEMENT,BRIARCLIFF MANOR,"PACE UNIV, PO BOX 3020, 235 ELM RD, BRIARCLIFF MANOR, NY 10510-8020 USA",1941-6520,1941-6067,,ACAD MANAG ANN,Acad.

We tested the effects of both of these types of input on laughter in children with ASD. Sensitivity to facial feedback was tested in 43 children with ASD, aged 8-14 years, and 43 typically developing children matched for mental age (6-14), in order to examine whether children with ASD use bodily feedback as an implicit source of information. Specifically, children were asked to view cartoons as they normally would (control condition), and while holding a pencil in their mouth forcing their smiling muscles into activation (feedback condition) while rating their enjoyment of the cartoons. The authors also explored the effects of social input in children with ASD by investigating whether the presence of a caregiver or friend (companion condition), or the presence of a laugh track superimposed upon the cartoon (laugh track condition) increased the children's self-rated enjoyment of cartoons or the amount of positive affect they displayed. Results showed that the group with ASD was less affected by all three experimental conditions, but also that group differences seemed to have been driven by one specific symptom of ASD: restricted range of affect. The strong relationship between restricted affect and insensitivity to facial feedback found in this study sheds light on the implications of restricted affect for social development in ASD.","[Helt, Molly S.] Trinity Coll, Dept Neurosci, Hartford, CT 06106 USA; [Helt, Molly S.] Trinity Coll, Dept Psychol, Hartford, CT 06106 USA; [Fein, Deborah A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Hartford, CT 06112 USA","Helt, MS (reprint author), Trinity Coll, Dept Neurosci, 300 Summit St, Hartford, CT 06106 USA.",Molly.helt@trincoll.edu; Deborah.fein@uconn.edu,,,Autism Speaks,"This research was supported by a pre-doctoral, mentor-based fellowship awarded to Deborah Fein and Molly Helt by Autism Speaks.",,64,4,4,3,31,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0162-3257,1573-3432,,J AUTISM DEV DISORD,J.

Drawing from facial feedback theory, the mediating role of source expressive display-based judgments on the influence of source facial expressions on consumer attitudes toward advertising stimuli, attitudes toward endorsed brands, and behavioral intention is examined. In addition, the examination of expressive display-based judgments as an automatic phenomenon, contingent on the familiarity of the source and the perceived match with the product endorsed is investigated. Across three studies, the facial expression of a source (resting vs. smiling) is manipulated within endorsement contexts. Results demonstrate that when an endorser is pictured in an advertisement with a smiling facial expression, consumers report feeling more pleasant (pleasure), with this positive emotional response mediating the relationship between source expressive display and attitude toward an advertisement, attitude toward a brand, and purchase intention. Results also indicate that the emotional response derived from the presence of a smiling source in an advertisement occurs effortlessly, yet only for a familiar source and one that is perceived to match the product endorsed, indicating this process can be defined as automatic under certain conditions. The findings from these studies provide advertisers with an effective cue to enhance a consumer's emotional response to advertisements, which in turn heighten advertisement, brand, and behavioral based judgments.

In the disembodied view, concepts are abstract entities; hence our multimodal experiences in the outside world have no impact on their representation. In the embodied view, concepts are dynamically modulated as a result of our experiences and interactions in the world. In this chapter, I discuss the hypothesis raised by Pavlenko (Emotions and Multilingualism, New York, 2005; Int J Psychol 47(6): 405-428, 2012), according to which affective experiences may be disembodied in the second language. I begin by briefly addressing the theoretical distinction between the embodied and disembodied views of cognition. Next, I review evidence from monolingual literature supporting the view that semantic and affective meaning are grounded in the perceptual, somatosensory, motor, and introspective experiences. Building on the Language and Situated Simulation hypothesis (Barsalou et al., Symbols and embodiment: debates on meaning and cognition, Oxford, pp. 245-283, 2008), I discuss the crucial role of the simulation system in the acquisition of affective meaning, and argue that its activation might be minimal for second language acquired in an instructed context. I support this claim with evidence from bilingualism and emotion research. I end this chapter with a word of caution by paying attention to numerous factors that may impact affective embodiment in bilinguals.","[Jonczyk, Rafal] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac English, Poznan, Poland","Jonczyk, R (reprint author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac English, Poznan, Poland.",,,,,,,68,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-47635-3; 978-3-319-47634-6,BILINGUAL MIND BRAIN,,,2016,,,,,,,149,159,,10.1007/978-3-319-47635-3_7,10.1007/978-3-319-47635-3,,,11,"Linguistics; Language & Linguistics; Psychology, Experimental",Linguistics; Psychology,BJ2NO,WOS:000419722500008,,,,,4/26/19

Only in the last few decades has this view been accepted in mainstream research by economists and psychologists studying decisional processes. Many studies now provide compelling evidence that the experience of various different emotions influence changes in decisional outcomes. Emerging research on emotion regulation, however, highlights that humans typically make efforts to control emotion experiences. This leaves open the possibility that decision effects attributed to acute emotions may be affected by regulatory strategies. If so, this raises the additional possibility that different regulation strategies could have different implications for economic decisions. Researchers have recently begun to study these possibilities and discovered that emotion regulation can indeed modulate effects that task-related and incidental emotions have on decisions. In this chapter, we provide a review of the empirical studies that have investigated the effects of regulatory strategies on social and economic decisions. We present an overview of the concept of emotion regulation by referring to the different types of regulatory strategies and their cognitive and behavioral effects. We proceed to review empirical studies relevant for various types of decision-making, such as risk and ambiguity, susceptibility to framing, and economic bargaining. We conclude by discussing practical implications of this rapidly evolving research topic.","[Heilman, Renata M.; Miu, Andrei C.] Babes Bolyai Univ, Dept Psychol, 37 Republ, Cluj Napoca 400015, CJ, Romania; [Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Univ Dr,MSN 1B2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Econ Sci, 4400 Univ Dr,MSN 1B2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Houser, D (reprint author), George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Univ Dr,MSN 1B2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.; Houser, D (reprint author), George Mason Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Econ Sci, 4400 Univ Dr,MSN 1B2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",dhouser@gmu.edu,,,,,,106,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",2196-6605,2196-6613,978-3-642-35923-1; 978-3-642-35922-4,STUD NEUROSCI,Stud.

While it could have simply remained a metaphor, the concept of contagion has become central to account for situations of emotional convergence between individuals. In this respect, the primitive emotional contagion model introduced by Hatfield and colleagues in 1994 assumes that we have a strong tendency to mimic the facial, postural and vocal motor behaviour of the people we interact with. This claim resembles the shared representations framework, according to which we make use of our own motor resources to access and share others' states.

The current study elaborated on theory pertaining to within-episode emotional labor dynamics, utilizing a call center simulation to examine how shifts in customer incivility impacted on continuous measures (captured every 200 milliseconds) of participants' felt emotions, surface acting, deep acting, and vocal tone during a single interaction. Results provided evidence that customer behavior causally influences within-episode changes in emotions, emotion regulation, and vocal tone, and that these key emotional labor variables significantly relate to each other at the momentary level of analysis. Further, by modeling lagged effects, we were able to gain insight into the causal direction in the relationships among these continuously measured variables.

In the ACE, people process sentences implying movement toward or away from themselves, responding with actions toward or away from their bodies. These processes interact, implying a linkage between linguistic and motor systems. From a theoretical perspective, the ACE has been extremely influential, being widely cited evidence in favor of embodied cognition. The present study began as an attempt to extend the ACE in a new direction, but eventually became a series of attempts to simply replicate the effect. Across 8 experiments, I tested whether the ACE extends to a novel mouse-tracking method and/or is susceptible to higher-order cognitive influences. In 3 experiments, attempts were made to ""disembody"" the ACE by presenting participants' names on the computer screen (as in Markman & Brendl, 2005). In each experiment, the ACE could not be disembodied, because the ACE did not occur. In further experiments, the ACE was not observed in reading times, regardless of response mode (mouse movements vs. button-presses) or stimuli, including those from the original research. Similarly, no ACE was observed in physical movement times. Bayes Factor analyses of the current experiments, and the previous ACE literature, suggest that the evidence for the ACE is generally weak: Many studies considered as positive evidence actually support the null hypothesis, and very few published results offer strong evidence for the ACE. Implications for the embodiment hypothesis are discussed.","[Papesh, Megan H.] Louisiana State Univ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Papesh, MH (reprint author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Psychol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",mpapesh@lsu.edu,,,National Institutes of Health/National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development [R01 HD075800-01],"Support provided by National Institutes of Health/National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development grant R01 HD075800-01.

We propose that sadness expressions can increase the expressers' ability to claim value in negotiations because they make recipients experience greater other-concern for the expresser. However, only when the social situation provides recipients with reasons to experience concern for the expresser in the first place, will recipients act on their other-concern and, eventually, concede more to a sad expresser. Three experiments tested this proposition by examining face-to-face, actual negotiations (in which participants interacted with each other). In all 3 experiments, recipients conceded more to a sad expresser when, but only when, features of the social situation provided reasons to experience other-concern for the expresser, namely (a) when recipients perceived the expresser as low power (Experiment 1), (b) when recipients anticipated a future interaction (Experiment 1), (c) when recipients construed the relationship as collaborative in nature (Experiment 2), or (d) when recipients believed that it was inappropriate to blame others (Experiment 3).

Methods: The authors performed a literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials. The primary investigators of the studies were contacted for additional unpublished data. Results: The authors identified 5 studies that met the criteria of using BTA in the treatment of MDD. All studies showed significant reduction in depressive symptoms with BTA injected into the glabellar muscles. In a pooled analysis, botulinum toxin (n = 59) vs placebo (n = 75) had a -47% vs -16% reduction in self-rated depression scores (P < 0.0001) and a -46% vs -15% reduction in expert-rated depression scores (P < 0.0001), respectively. Adverse reactions were mild (temporary headaches and local irritation immediately after injection) and did not differ between active group (13.6%) and placebo group (9.3%) (P = 0.44). Conclusions: Botulinum toxin injections in the glabellar frown muscles have been associated with a significant improvement in depressive symptoms. Given the prevalence of MDD, the promising results of preliminary trials, and the excellent tolerability of this treatment intervention, larger studies are warranted.","Univ Texas Austin, Univ Texas Med Branch, Dept Psychiat, Dell Med Sch, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Texas Austin, Texas A&M Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Psychiat, Dell Med Sch, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Texas Austin, Dept Dermatol, Dell Med Sch, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Magid, M (reprint author), Austin Psychcare PA, 1600 West 38th St,Suite 404, Austin, TX 78731 USA.",michellemagid@austinpsychcare.com,,,Brain and Behavior Research Foundation,"Dr. Magid received a young investigator grant from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation to fund her original study on the treatment of depression using botulinum toxin A.

This review discusses behavioral, neuroscientific, and cognitive research connecting these bodily movements with emotive responses. General bodily feedback theories of emotion have suggested that manipulated facial expressions and postures influence emotive reactions to stimuli as well as physiological responses such as heart rate, skin conductance, and the temperature of blood entering the brain. More recent evidence suggests that manipulated bodily states influence prefrontal cortical activation and amygdala activation. Even further evidence has suggested that manipulated bodily states influence cognitive processes, such as the speed at which individuals read emotional content, the speed at which they classify information as emotional, and the extent to which they determine emotional information as threatening. Bodily feedback theories may also suggest clinical applications. Bodily feedback theories of emotion therefore have generated research showing that bodily expressions play a pivotal role in our emotive experiences.

However, the underlying neural mechanism whereby one's facial emotion modulates the visual cortical responses to other's facial expressions remains unknown. To understand how one's facial expression affects visual processing, we measured participants' visual evoked potentials (VEPs) during a facial emotion judgment task of positive and neutral faces. To control for the effects of facial muscles on VEPs, we asked participants to smile (adopting an expression of happiness), to purse their lips (incompatible with smiling) or to pose with a neutral face, in separate blocks. Results showed that the smiling expression modulates face-specific visual processing components (N170/vertex positive potential) to watching other facial expressions. Specifically, when making a happy expression, neutral faces are processed similarly to happy faces. When making a neutral expression or pursing the lips, however, responses to neutral and happy face are significantly different. This effect was source localized within multisensory associative areas, angular gyrus, associative visual cortex and somatosensory cortex. We provide novel evidence that one's own emotional expression acts as a top-down influence modulating low-level neural encoding during facial perception.","[Sel, Alejandra] Univ London, Dept Psychol, Lab Act & Body, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Sel, Alejandra; Calvo-Merino, Beatriz; Tuettenberg, Simone; Forster, Bettina] City Univ London, Dept Psychol, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Calvo-Merino, Beatriz] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Psychol, Madrid 28223, Spain","Sel, A (reprint author), Univ London, Dept Psychol, Egham Hill, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",alex.sel@rhul.ac.uk,,"Calvo-Merino, Beatriz/0000-0003-4669-4573","Spanish Ministry of Education [AP2008-00664]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [RYC-2008-03090, PSI2012-34558]; City University Pump Priming Scheme",The authors thank Karin Chellew for her help in data collection and Vivien Ainley for her help in proofreading the manuscript.

In the present selective review, we provide a framework for understanding self-other integration and distinction, and impairments herein in schizophrenia. For this purpose, we discuss classic motor prediction models in relation to mirror neuron functioning, theory of mind, mimicry, self-awareness, and self-agency phenomena. Importantly, we also discuss the role of more recent cognitive expectation models in these phenomena, and argue that these cognitive models form an essential contribution to our understanding of self-other integration and distinction. In doing so, we bring together different lines of research and connect findings from social psychology, affective neuropsychology, and psychiatry to further our understanding of when and how people integrate versus distinguish self and other, and how this goes wrong in schizophrenia patients.

We learn what to feel from others, especially when we are children. We catch other people's emotions just by being around them. We get caught in escalating response-counterresponse emotional sequences. This all takes place in time, generating complex patterns of interpersonal emotional dynamics.

Despite its fundamental role in social life, knowledge about the neural basis of laughter is very limited and mostly based on a few electrical stimulation (ES) studies carried out in epileptic patients. In these studies laughter was elicited from temporal areas where it was accompanied by mirth and from frontal areas plus an anterior cingulate case where laughter without mirth was observed. On the basis of these findings, it has been proposed a dichotomy between temporal lobe areas processing the emotional content of laughter and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and motor areas responsible of laughter production. The present study is aimed to understand the role of ACC in laughter. We report the effects of stimulation of 10 rostral, pregenual ACC (pACC) patients in which the ES elicited laughter. In half of the patients ES elicited a clear burst of laughter with mirth, while in the other half mirth was not evident. This large dataset allow us to offer a more reliable picture of the functional contribute of this region in laughter, and to precisely localize it in the cingulate cortex. We conclude that the pACC is involved in both the motor and the affective components of emotions, and challenge the validity of a sharp dichotomy between motor and emotional centers for laughing. Finally, we suggest a possible anatomical network for the production of positive emotional expressions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Counter to views that EC is the product of automatic learning processes, recent research has revealed various characteristics of nonautomatic processing in EC. The current research investigated the controllability of EC by testing the effectiveness of 3 emotion-focused strategies in preventing the acquisition of conditioned preferences: (a) suppression of emotional reactions to the US, (b) reappraisal of the valence of the US, and (c) facial blocking of emotional responses. Although all 3 strategies reduced EC effects on self-reported evaluations by impairing recollective memory for CS-US pairings, they were ineffective in reducing EC effects on an evaluative priming measure. Regardless of the measure, effective control did not depend on the level of arousal elicited by the US. The results suggest that the 3 strategies can influence deliberate CS evaluations through memory-related processes, but they are ineffective in reducing EC effects on spontaneous evaluative responses.

Fifty-three healthy adults observed self-paced morph sequences where the emotional facial expression either changed quantitatively (i.e., sad-to-neutral, neutral-to-sad, happy-to-neutral, neutral-to-happy) or qualitatively (i.e. from sad to happy, or from happy to sad). Observers held a pen in their own mouth to induce smiling or frowning during the detection task. When morph sequences started or ended with neutral expressions we replicated a congruency effect: Happiness was perceived longer and sooner while smiling; sadness was perceived longer and sooner while frowning. Interestingly, no such congruency effects occurred for transitions between emotional expressions. These results suggest that facial feedback is especially useful when evaluating the intensity of a facial expression, but less so when we have to recognize which emotion our counterpart is expressing.","[Lobmaier, Janek S.] Univ Bern, Inst Psychol, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Fischer, Martin H.] Univ Potsdam, Div Cognit Sci, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany","Lobmaier, JS (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Psychol, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",janek.lobmaier@psy.unibe.ch; martinf@uni-potsdam.de,"Fischer, Martin/D-9965-2017","Lobmaier, Janek/0000-0001-8025-1616",Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P1_139072/1],Janek S.

Here, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied to the right primary motor cortex (M1), the right primary somatosensory cortex (Si), or, in a control condition, the vertex (VTX). Facial mimicry of smiles and emotion judgments were recorded in response to video clips depicting changes from neutral or angry to happy facial expressions. While in females rTMS over M1 and Si compared to VTX led to reduced mimicry and, in the case of M1, delayed detection of smiles, there was no effect of TMS condition for males. We conclude that in female participants M1 and Si play a role in the mimicry and in the use of facial feedback for accurate processing of smiles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is further assumed that affect diffusion primarily occurs as the result of people's tendencies to synchronize their affective actions (such as smiles and frowns). However, as we show, there is a lack of clarity in the literature about the substrate and scope of affect diffusion. One consequence of this is a difficulty in distinguishing between affect diffusion and several other affective influence phenomena that look similar but have very different consequences. There is also a growing body of evidence that action synchrony is unlikely to be the only, or indeed the most important, pathway for affect diffusion. This paper has 2 key aims: (a) to craft a formal definition of affect diffusion that does justice to the core of the phenomenon while distinguishing it from other phenomena with which it is frequently confounded and (b) to advance a theory of the mechanisms of affect diffusion. This theory, which we call the multimodal theory of affect diffusion, identifies 3 parallel multimodal mechanisms that may act as routes for affect diffusion. It also provides a basis for novel predictions about the conditions under which affect is most likely to diffuse.","[Peters, Kim] Univ Queensland, Dept Psychol, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Kashima, Yoshihisa] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Peters, K (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Dept Psychol, McElwain Bldg, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",k.peters@uq.edu.au,,"Peters, Kim/0000-0001-8091-8636; Kashima, Yoshihisa/0000-0003-3627-3273",,,,277,6,6,4,56,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0033-2909,1939-1455,,PSYCHOL BULL,Psychol.

In particular, we will discuss mirror mechanisms, and assess the extent to which the body is recruited during these processes. We show that for emotion mirroring, this dependency is well-documented, but for action mirroring far less so. By reviewing these mechanisms and processes while contrasting body from brain, and social from general cognition, we show that both contrasts are arbitrary and problematic and that any study of cognitive processes, both social and general, should take the body into account.

However, how titles contribute to positive esthetic experiences is still an open issue. Considering that fluency, as well as effortful elaborate processing, potentially influence esthetic experiences, we tested how three different title types semantically matching (fluent), semantically non-matching (non-fluent), and an ""untitled"" condition (control) affected experiences of abstract, semi-abstract, and representational art. While participants viewed title/artwork combinations we assessed facial electromygraphic (fEMG) recordings over M. corrugator supercilii and M. zygomaticus major muscle to capture subtle changes in emotional and cognitive processing, and asked for subjective liking and interest. Matching titles, but also the more effortful untitled condition, produced higher liking compared to non-fluently processed, non-matching titles especially in abstract art. These results were reflected in fEMG with stronger M. corrugator activations in the non-matching condition followed by the untitled condition. This implies high cognitive effort as well as negative emotions. Only in the matching condition, M. zygomaticus was more strongly activated indicating positive emotions due to fluency. Interest, however, was hardly affected. These results show that high levels of dis-fluency and cognitive effort reduce liking. However, fluency as well as moderate levels of effort contribute to more positive esthetic experiences.","[Gerger, Gernot; Leder, Helmut] Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Dept Psychol Basic Res, A-1010 Vienna, Austria","Gerger, G (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Fac Psychol, Dept Psychol Basic Res, Liebiggasse 5, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",gernot.gerger@univie.ac.at,"Gerger, Gernot/W-3534-2018","Gerger, Gernot/0000-0001-5189-3441",Open Access Publishing Fund of the University of Vienna,This article was supported by the Open Access Publishing Fund of the University of Vienna.

Across 68 effect sizes (computed on 3169 participants), a small, significant average compatibility effect emerged (ES = .118; 95% CI [.051, .185]). Importantly, analyses also revealed significant heterogeneity in the set of effect sizes. Moderator analyses were conducted to explain this observed heterogeneity with a view to testing between extant theoretical accounts of the compatibility effect. Affective compatibility effects were significantly larger (1) for face stimuli than for words or pictorial stimuli; (2) when the negative stimuli partly comprising the effect were anger-related; (3) for responses made using vertical button press; (4) when situated aspects of the processing task framed flexion as approach and extension as avoidance; and (5) when explicit response labels framed flexion as positive and extension as negative. Significant reverse compatibility effects emerged (1) when aspects of the processing context framed flexion as avoidance and extension as approach and (2) when explicit response labels framed flexion as negative and extension as positive. The results of the meta-analysis provide little support for the strong embodiment, specific muscle activation account of affective compatibility and are broadly consistent with distance regulation, and, in particular, evaluative coding accounts.","[Laham, Simon M.; Kashima, Yoshihisa; Dix, Jennifer; Wheeler, Melissa] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Laham, SM (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Psychol Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",slaham@unimelb.edu.au,,"Wheeler, Melissa/0000-0002-0319-1987; Kashima, Yoshihisa/0000-0003-3627-3273; Laham, Simon/0000-0002-9101-9553",Asian Office of Aerospace RD [FA2386-09-4093]; Australian Research Council [DP1095323],The research reported in this article was supported by a grant from the Asian Office of Aerospace R&D (Award No. FA2386-09-4093) and a grant from the Australian Research Council (DP1095323) to Yoshihisa Kashima and Simon M.

At first sight, social cognition seems embodied cognition par excellence. Social cognition is first and foremost a supra-individual, interactive, and dynamic process (Semin & Smith, 2013). Radical approaches in Situated/Embodied Cognitive Science (Enactivism) claim that social cognition consists in an emergent pattern of interaction between a continuously coupled organism and the (social) environment; it rejects representationalist accounts of cognition (Hutto & Myin, 2013). However, mainstream ESP (Barsalou, 1999, 2008) still takes a rather representation-friendly approach that construes embodiment in terms of specific bodily formatted representations used (activated) in social cognition. We argue that mainstream ESP suffers from vestiges of theoretical solipsism, which may be resolved by going beyond internalistic spirit that haunts mainstream ESP today.","[Pouw, Wim T. J.

Thus, subjective reality matters more than objective reality. Furthermore, only the perceived valence of the participants' own contributionsand not of their conversation partnersinfluences binge drinking intentions, indicating that self-persuasion is more influential than persuasion by others. Thus, conversations in which discussants themselves express negative opinions about unhealthy behaviors can enhance public health.","[Hendriks, Hanneke; van den Putte, Bas; de Bruijn, Gert-Jan] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Hendriks, H (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Dept Social & Org Psychol, Pieter Court Bldg,Wassenaarseweg 52, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands.",H.Hendriks@fsw.leidenuniv.nl,,,,,,46,6,6,2,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1081-0730,1087-0415,,J HEALTH COMMUN,J.

Although some moderators and driving mechanisms have been identified, a comprehensive conceptual account of how bodily states or dynamics influence behavior is still missing. Here, we attempt to integrate current knowledge by describing three basic psychological mechanisms: direct state induction, which influences how humans feel or process information, unmediated by any other cognitive mechanism; modal priming, which changes the accessibility of concepts associated with a bodily state; sensorimotor simulation, which affects the ease with which congruent and incongruent actions are performed. We argue that the joint impact of these mechanisms can account for most existing embodiment effects. Additionally, we summarize empirical tests for distinguishing these mechanisms and suggest a guideline for future research about the mechanisms underlying embodiment effects.","[Koerner, Anita; Strack, Fritz] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol 2, Roentgenring 10, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Topolinski, Sascha] Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol, Social & Econ Cognit, D-50931 Cologne, Germany","Korner, A (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol 2, Roentgenring 10, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",anita.koerner@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,"German Research Foundation (DFG) [TO 705/1-1, Str 264/26-1]; University of Wuerzburg","This publication was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the University of Wuerzburg in the funding programme Open Access Publishing.

Niedenthal et al. (1999) advanced a fine-grained theory of emotional response categorization, arguing that emotional states increase the tendency to categorize concepts into a predictable set of emotional response categories characterized by the common, distinct emotional responses elicited by the concepts. Based on the pioneering work of Niedenthal et al., we further argued that (1) the specific emotion experienced by the individual should selectively facilitate the categorization of concepts associated with the same emotion, (2) both in terms of category inclusion and category exclusion, and (3) this facilitation effect should not be contingent on the awareness of the emotional state. In three experiments, participants were induced to experience different emotional states through movies or a facial-feedback manipulation. They judged whether or not a target concept belonged to the same category as the two comparison concepts. Some of the concept triads shared emotional associations, while others didn't. Results showed that emotive participants had a greater tendency than those in a neutral mood to group concepts according to their emotional associations, and to distinguish concepts with different emotional associations. They were also more efficient in categorizing concepts that had specific emotional meaning corresponding to their own emotional state than to other emotional concepts. Furthermore, participants posing a disgust expression without their knowledge showed higher tendency to categorize concepts according to their relevance to disgust. Implications and potential applications of the findings were discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Participants adopted high-power (i.e., expansive, open) poses or low-power (i.e., contractive, closed) poses, and then prepared and delivered a speech to 2 evaluators as part of a mock job interview. All interview speeches were videotaped and coded for overall performance and hireability and for 2 potential mediators: verbal content (e.g., structure, content) and nonverbal presence (e.g., captivating, enthusiastic). As predicted, those who prepared for the job interview with high- (vs. low-) power poses performed better and were more likely to be chosen for hire; this relation was mediated by nonverbal presence, but not by verbal content. Although previous research has focused on how a nonverbal behavior that is enacted during interactions and observed by perceivers affects how those perceivers evaluate and respond to the actor, this experiment focused on how a nonverbal behavior that is enacted before the interaction and unobserved by perceivers affects the actor's performance, which, in turn, affects how perceivers evaluate and respond to the actor. This experiment reveals a theoretically novel and practically informative result that demonstrates the causal relation between preparatory nonverbal behavior and subsequent performance and outcomes.","[Cuddy, Amy J.

It consists of three stages: recognition of an emotion through mimicry, joint embodiment of the emotion which leads to empathy(1), and finally contagion. ""People tend a) to automatically mimic the facial expressions, vocal expressions, and instrumental behaviors of those around them, and thereby b) to feel a pale reflection of others' emotions as a consequence of such feedback. The result is that people tend c) to catch one another's emotions"" (Hatfield et al. 2011, 26). This leads to the spectator converging emotionally with the performer (and often with other spectators) in a shared embodiment of that emotion.","[Mee, Erin B.] NYU, Dept English, 244 Greene St,706, New York, NY 10003 USA","Mee, EB (reprint author), NYU, Dept English, 244 Greene St,706, New York, NY 10003 USA.",erinmee1@gmail.com,,,,,,94,0,0,2,2,SOC ED IL MULINO,BOLOGNA,"STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY",1826-8889,2279-7777,,RETI SAPERI LINGUAGG,Reti Saperi Linguaggi,JUL-DEC,2015,2,2,,,,,257,279,,10.12832/82681,,,,23,Philosophy,Philosophy,VE0HM,WOS:000438233200005,,,,,4/26/19

On Gurwitsch's account, as we develop it, the field of consciousness has a variable sized focus or ""theme"" of attention surrounded by a structured periphery of inattentional contents. As the field evolves, its contents change their status, sometimes smoothly, sometimes abruptly. Inner thoughts, a sense of one's body, and the physical environment are dominant field contents. These ideas can be linked with (and help unify) contemporary theories about the neural correlates of consciousness, inattention, the small world structure of the brain, meta-stable dynamics, embodied cognition, and predictive coding in the brain.

Recent studies showed that people assign higher value to goods that are closer to them, even when physical proximity should be irrelevant for the decision from a normative perspective. This phenomenon, however, seems reasonable from an evolutionary perspective. Most foraging decisions of animals involve the trade-off between the value that can be obtained and the associated effort of obtaining. Anticipated effort for physically obtaining a good could therefore affect the subjective value of this good. In this experiment, we test this hypothesis by letting participants state their subjective value for snack food while the effort that would be incurred when reaching for it was manipulated. Even though reaching was not required in the experiment, we find that willingness to pay was significantly lower when subjects wore heavy wristbands on their arms. Thus, when reaching was more difficult, items were perceived as less valuable. Importantly, this was only the case when items were physically in front of the participants but not when items were presented as text on a computer screen. Our results suggest automatic interactions of motor and valuation processes which are unexplored to this date and may account for irrational decisions that occur when reward is particularly easy to reach.","[Gross, Jorg; Woelbert, Eva] Maastricht Univ, Dept Cognit Neurosci, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Gross, Jorg; Woelbert, Eva; Strobel, Martin] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands","Gross, J (reprint author), Maastricht Univ, Dept Cognit Neurosci, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",mail@joerg-gross.net,,"Woelbert, Eva/0000-0001-9205-7845; Gross, Jorg/0000-0002-5403-9475",,,,70,3,3,0,6,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,10-Jun,2015,10,6,,,,,,,e0127619,10.1371/journal.pone.0127619,,,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CK1PO,WOS:000355979500045,26061087,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,4/26/19

Present actions are emotionally guided by those somatic states that were previously activated in similar experiences. In this model, somatic markers serve as a kind of embodied memory. Here, we test whether the manipulation of somatic markers can modulate the emotional evaluation of negative memories. Because facial feedback has been shown to be a powerful means of modifying emotional judgements, we used it to manipulate somatic markers. Participants first read a sad story in order to induce a negative emotional memory and then were asked to rate their emotions and memory about the text. Twenty-four hours later, the same participants were asked to assume a predetermined facial feedback (smiling) while reactivating their memory of the sad story. The participants were once again asked to fill in emotional and memory questionnaires about the text. Our results showed that participants who had smiled during memory reactivation later rated the text less negatively than control participants. However, the contraction of the zygomaticus muscles during memory reactivation did not have any impact on episodic memory scores. This suggests that manipulating somatic states modified emotional memory without affecting episodic memory. Thus, modulating memories through bodily states might pave the way to studying memory as an embodied function and help shape new kinds of psychotherapeutic interventions.","[Arminjon, Mathieu; Preissmann, Delphine; Chmetz, Florian; Duraku, Andrea; Ansermet, Francois; Magistretti, Pierre J.] Agalma Fdn, Geneva, Switzerland; [Arminjon, Mathieu; Ansermet, Francois] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychiat, Fac Med, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Preissmann, Delphine; Duraku, Andrea] Univ Lausanne, Inst Psychol, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Preissmann, Delphine; Chmetz, Florian; Magistretti, Pierre J.] Lausanne Univ Hosp Ctr, Ctr Psychiat Neurosci, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Magistretti, Pierre J.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Brain Mind Inst, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Magistretti, Pierre J.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Bio & Environm Sci & Engn, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","Arminjon, M (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Dept Psychiat, Fac Med, Rue Verte 2, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.",mathieu.arminjon@unige.ch,,"Magistretti, Pierre Julius/0000-0002-6678-320X",,,,49,7,7,3,26,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

It is not yet clear, however, what effects emotional acceptance has on early emotion response dynamics. To address this question, participants (N = 37) were shown emotional pictures and cued either to simply attend to them, or to accept or suppress their emotional responses. Continuous measures of emotion experience, expressive behavior, and autonomic responses were obtained. Results indicated that, compared to no regulation, acceptance led to more positive emotions, transiently enhanced expressivity, and lowered respiratory rate. Compared to suppression, acceptance led to more positive emotions, stronger expressivity, and smaller changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and pulse amplitude, as well as greater oxygenation. Acceptance and suppression thus have opposite effects on emotional response dynamics. Because acceptance enhances positive emotion experience and expression, this strategy may be particularly useful in facilitating social interactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this review, we used the process model of emotion regulation (Gross, 1998) to organize the existing literature on positive interventions and to advance theory by clarifying the mechanisms underlying their effectiveness. We have proposed that positive emotions can be increased both in the short-and longer-term through 5 families of emotion regulation strategies (i.e., situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation), showing how these emotion regulation strategies can be applied before, during, and after positive emotional events. Regarding short-term increases in positive emotions, our review found that attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation strategies have received the most empirical support, whereas more work is needed to establish the effectiveness of situation selection and situation modification strategies. Regarding longer-term increases in positive emotions, strategies such as situation selection during an event and attentional deployment before, during, and after an event have received strong empirical support and are at the center of many positive interventions. However, more work is needed to establish the specific benefits of the other strategies, especially situation modification. We argue that our emotion regulation framework clarifies existing interventions and points the way for new interventions that might be used to increase positive emotions in both nonclinical and clinical populations.","[Quoidbach, Jordi] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Mikolajczak, Moira] Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Psychol, Louvain, Belgium; [Gross, James J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Quoidbach, J (reprint author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",jordi.quoidbach@upf.edu,,"Mikolajczak, Moira/0000-0002-7333-1578",,,,293,68,71,14,136,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0033-2909,1939-1455,,PSYCHOL BULL,Psychol.

We address this question in the case of the integers. Existing research suggests that adult mental representations of integers recruit perceptuo-motor functionalities involving symmetry. Building on these findings, we designed a hands-on curriculum that emphasizes symmetry to teach integer concepts to fourth graders. Compared to two control conditions, children who went through the experimental curriculum showed evidence of incorporating symmetry into their mental representations of integers and performed higher on problems beyond the scope of instruction, including negative fractions and algebra-readiness problems. Gains did not come at the expense of basic integer computation skill. This study has direct practical implications, as current integers curricula generally omit symmetry. The research demonstrates an approach to designing instruction that involves identifying perceptuo-motor functionalities underlying numerical cognition and creating learning activities to recruit them.","[Tsang, Jessica M.; Blair, Kristen P.; Schwartz, Daniel L.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bofferding, Laura] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Tsang, JM (reprint author), Stanford Grad Sch Educ, AAA Lab, 450 Serra Mall,Wallenberg Hall Bldg 160,Rm 430, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jmtsang@stanford.edu,,,National Science Foundation [DRL-0814768]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship,"The material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant DRL-0814768, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, and a Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship to J.M.T.

We also hypothesize that the mechanisms of body-mind therapeutic and educational systems (BTES) can be understood through the PS framework. We suggest that the BTES, including meditative movement, meditation, somatic education, and the body-oriented psychotherapies, are approaches that use interventions on the PS to remedy stress and trauma. We discuss how the PS can be adaptive or maladaptive, how BTES interventions may restore adaptive PS, and how these concepts offer a broader and more flexible view of the phenomena of stress and trauma. We offer supportive evidence for our hypotheses, and suggest directions for future research.

Results indicate that positively and negatively valenced words presented in context influence motor responses (Experiment 1), whilst valenced words presented in isolation do not (Experiment 3). Furthermore, whether discourse context indicates that an utterance should be interpreted literally or ironically can influence motor responding, suggesting that the grounding of language in emotional states can be influenced by discourse-level factors (Experiment 2). In addition, the finding of affect-related motor responses to certain forms of ironic language, but not to non-ironic control sentences, suggests that phrasing a message ironically may influence the emotional response that is elicited.

These studies have tended to view meditation as an individual endeavor; however, many people learn to practice meditation in a group. Drawing on literature that connects the self, emotional experience and social interaction, I suggest that meditation-based equanimity is not only a psychological state but also a social attitude that is cultivated and learned in a unique silent interaction order. Based on participant observation and in-depth interviews with participants in vipassana meditation retreats in Israel and the United States, I analyze instances of silent social interaction that take place in meditation centers. The analysis reveals a sociological understanding of equanimity as a sociality of ""non-engagement"" which serves as a grey zone between full engagement and complete disengagement. As I show, participants in meditation retreats go through a gradual process of learning how to be with others while not directly attending to them. This form of being together allows for the emergence of silent social attunement that facilitates equanimity.

Using new methodology to disassociate these multimodal processes (i.e., semantic, metaphoric, and sensorimotoric), the current work demonstrates that both sensorimotor and metaphor processes, combined, are needed to find an effect upon conceptual processing, providing evidence in support of the combined importance of these two theorized components. When participants comprehended the metaphor of hard Republicans and soft Democrats, and when encouraged to simulate sensorimotor experiences of hard and soft stimuli, those stimuli influenced categorization of faces as Republican and Democrat.

This article explores how these largely unrecognized threats raise real problems for the criminal justice system; from the collection and interpretation of traces to the presentation and evaluation of evidence at trial and on appeal. It explains how forensic analysts are routinely exposed to information (e.g. about the investigation or the main suspect) that is not related to their analysis, and not documented in their reports, but has been demonstrated to affect the interpretation of forensic science evidence. It also explains that not only are forensic analysts gratuitously exposed to such 'domain-irrelevant' information, but their own cognitively contaminated interpretations and opinions are then often unnecessarily revealed to other witnesses-both lay and expert. This back and forth can create a 'biasing snowball effect' where evidence is (increasingly) cross-contaminated, though represented, at trial and on appeal, as separate lines of evidence independently corroborating one another. The article explains that lawyers and courts have not recognized how contextual bias and cognitive processes may distort and undermine the probative value of expert evidence. It suggests that courts should attend to the possibility of contextual bias and cross-contamination when admitting and evaluating incriminating expert evidence.","[Edmond, Gary] Australian Res Council, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Edmond, Gary] Univ New S Wales, Sch Law, Expertise Evidence & Law Program, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Edmond, Gary] Northumbria Univ, Sch Law, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [Tangen, Jason M.; Searston, Rachel A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Dror, Itiel E.] UCL, Ctr Forens Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England","Edmond, G (reprint author), Australian Res Council, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",g.edmond@unsw.edu.au,,,"Australian Research Council (ARC) [FT0992041, LP100200142, LP120100063, N41756-10-C-3382]; United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)","Australian Research Council (ARC) (FT0992041 and LP100200142) to G.E., (LP120100063) to J.M.T. and G.E., (N41756-10-C-3382); the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to I.E.D.",,122,11,11,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1470-8396,1470-840X,,LAW PROBAB RISK,Law Probab.

These studies have focused on increasing intensity and amount of physical activity. In the present study, we investigated whether not only the intensity but also the style of physical activity affects depression related processes. Method: Using an unobtrusive biofeedback technique, we manipulated participants (39 undergraduates) to change their walking patterns to either reflect the characteristics of depressed patients or a particularly happy walking style. The intensity of walking (i.e. walking speed) was held constant across condition. During walking, participants first encoded and later recalled a series of emotionally loaded terms. Results: The difference between recalled positive and recalled negative words was much lower in participants who adopted a depressed walking style as compared to participants who walked as if they were happy. Limitations: The effects of gait manipulation were investigated in a non-clinical group of undergraduates. Conclusions: The observed change in memory bias supports the idea that beyond the intensity of walking the style of walking has effects on the Vulnerability to depression. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to induce a controlled perturbation in the emotional system of the brain by multimodal stimuli, and to investigate whether such emotional stimuli could induce reproducible and consistent changes in electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We exposed 12 subjects to auditory, visual, or combined audio-visual stimuli. Audio stimuli consisted of voice recordings of the Japanese word ""arigato"" (thank you) pronounced with three different intonations (angry-A, happy-H or neutral-N). Visual stimuli consisted of faces of women expressing the same emotional valences (A, H or N). Audio-visual stimuli were composed using either congruent combinations of faces and voices (e.g., H x H) or noncongruent combinations (e.g., A x H). The data were collected using an EEG system, and analysis was performed by computing the topographic distributions of EEG signals in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency ranges. We compared the conditions stimuli (A, H or N), and congruent versus noncongruent. Topographic maps of EEG power differed between those conditions. The obtained results demonstrate that EEG could be used as a tool to investigate emotional valence and discriminate various emotions.","[Hiyoshi-Taniguchi, K.; Yokota, T.; Bakardjian, H.; Cichocki, A.; Vialatte, F.

The goal of this review is to examine the current status and future prospects of this rapidly growing field. In the first section, I define emotion and emotion regulation and distinguish both from related constructs. In the second section, I use the process model of emotion regulation to selectively review evidence that different regulation strategies have different consequences. In the third section, I introduce the extended process model of emotion regulation; this model considers emotion regulation to be one type of valuation, and distinguishes three emotion regulation stages (identification, selection, implementation). In the final section, I consider five key growth points for the field of emotion regulation.","Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Gross, JJ (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",gross@stanford.edu,,,,,,237,369,385,57,325,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1047-840X,1532-7965,,PSYCHOL INQ,Psychol.

However, this claim is still controversial, as is the definition of Embodied Simulation. In this paper, I aim at providing a more suitable definition of Embodied Simulation. I will then apply this definition to the study of bodily metaphors. Embodied Simulation gets us attuned with our social world and it provides us with both a brain and bodily disposition, which is the starting point of many cognitive processes. Exploitation of the mechanism of simulation is particularly evident in the linguistic phenomenon of metaphors. Bodily metaphors are often so successful because they exploit this mechanism of brain and bodily attunement, enacted by means of Embodied Simulation. The role of Embodied Simulation and its importance for metaphor comprehension can be explained in two points: (1) Embodied Simulation allows speakers to share a bodily attitude during communicative exchanges; (2) by means of Embodied Simulation speakers directly experience the source domain during metaphorical mapping.","[Cuccio, Valentina] Univ Palermo, Dept Humanities, Viale Sci,Edificio 12, I-90128 Palermo, Italy","Cuccio, V (reprint author), Univ Palermo, Dept Humanities, Viale Sci,Edificio 12, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",valentina.cuccio@unipa.it,,"Cuccio, Valentina/0000-0001-7908-4216",,,,74,2,2,1,4,FRANCO ANGELI EDIZIONI,MILAN,"VIALE MONZA 106, MILAN, 20127, ITALY",0392-9760,1825-652X,,EPISTEMOLOGIA,Epistemologia,JAN-JUN,2015,38,1,,,,,99,113,,,,,,15,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,DE6VR,WOS:000370772200007,,,,,4/26/19

This required participants to react with either the zygomatic major muscles (smile) or the corrugator supercilii muscles (frown) when exposed to different stimuli, some of which were ambiguous statements. While contracting the required facial muscles, participants also rated each stimulus on a negative-positive scale. Results indicated that participants contracting smiling muscles during ambiguous statements rated those statements as significantly more positive than participants contracting frowning-relevant muscles. This effect remained significant in participants who were unaware of the purpose of the experiment, and unaware that the experiment was related to mood. Previous studies have demonstrated that facial expressions can reflect the valency of a bias in responding to ambiguous stimuli (e.g. Neta, Norris, & Whalen, 2009), but the present study goes further by suggesting that facial expressions can actively influence the interpretation of stimuli as complex as verbal statements. Some of the implications for the way in which facial expressions may influence cognitive processes relevant to psychopathology are discussed. (C) Copyright 2014 Textrum Ltd.

Recently, the consequences of ambivalence have been the subject of considerable research attention. In this chapter, we provide an overview of this research and present the ABC (Affect, Behavior, Cognition) model of ambivalence that integrates recent insights into the affective, behavioral, and cognitive consequences of ambivalence. This research shows when and why ambivalence leads to negative affect and that this affective response is the fuel that drives subsequent effects of ambivalence on cognition and behavior. Moreover, the reviewed findings reveal that the effects on cognition and behavior serve the purpose of either resolving ambivalence or mitigating the negative affective response. With the ABC model of ambivalence, we aim to identify the distinctive features of ambivalence in terms of what we feel, think, and do.","[van Harreveld, Frenk; Nohlen, Hannah U.] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Social Psychol Program, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Schneider, Iris K.] Univ So Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Schneider, Iris K.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, Amsterdam, Netherlands","van Harreveld, F (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Social Psychol Program, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",f.vanharreveld@uva.nl,,,,,,146,28,28,6,38,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0065-2601,,978-0-12-802435-5; 978-0-12-802247-4,ADV EXP SOC PSYCHOL,Adv.

The focal point of this study is the conceptualization of the term ""affect"" with regard to the other affective phenomena (specifically emotion and mood). Our definition of affect is substantially different than existing Czech terminology and we define affect as the necessary component of all affective processes. Contrary to the Czech traditional concept of affect, we do not attribute characteristics such as ""high intensity"" or ""dis-organising influence"" on cognitive processes, behaviour, etc. per se. We define affect in accordance with many authors, as a point in the continuum of affective stream and the basic unit of all affective phenomena. Affective phenomena or processes we consider as an umbrella term for a complex phenomenon like affect, emotion, mood, emotional episode, interpersonal attitude, sentiment, passion and so on: their common component is the affect. We consider emotion as a figure that emerges in the affective stream as a complex reaction to the event that has meaning for an individual and is interpreted with respect to the experience, context, individual characteristic, and sociocultural environment of the individual. Contrary to the Czech tradition, emotions are viewed as ""just"" one type of affective phenomena with a relatively specific definitional framework. The moods are considered parts of the affective stream continuum that have a specific and for consciousness accessible quality. The concepts of affect, emotion and mood discussed in this paper are contrasted; however, we have described where they overlap conceptually. The relationships of all affective phenomena have been considered as interacting with a tendency to synchronize into one (for an individual typical) affective stream.","[Polackova Solcova, Iva] Psychol Ustav AV CR, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic; [Trnka, Radek] Prazska Vysoka Skola Psychosocialnich Studii, Fak Humanitnich Studii UK, Prague, Czech Republic","Polackova Solcova, I (reprint author), Psychol Ustav AV CR, Hybernska 8, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",polackova@praha.psu.cas.cz,"Trnka, Radek/S-7776-2017; Polackova Solcova, Iva/H-6837-2014","Trnka, Radek/0000-0003-3731-468X; Polackova Solcova, Iva/0000-0003-3130-5416",,,,144,0,0,0,8,ACADEMIA,PRAGUE 1,"PUBL HOUSE CZECH ACAD SCI VODICKOVA 40, PRAGUE 1 112 29, CZECH REPUBLIC",0009-062X,1804-6436,,CESK PSYCHOL,Cesk.

But group emotion research within organizational science has suffered in recent years from a lack of terminological clarity, from a narrow focus on small groups, and from an overemphasis on micro-processes of emotion transmission. We address those problems by reviewing and systematically integrating relevant work conducted not only in organizational science, but also in psychology and sociology. We offer a definition of group emotions and sort the conceptual space along four dimensions: group emotion responses, recognition, regulation, and reiteration. We provide evidence that group emotions occur at all levels of analysis, including levels beyond small work groups. The accounts of group emotion emergence at higher levels of analysis differ substantially between organizational science, psychology, and sociology. We review these accounts-emergence through inclination, interaction, institutionalization, or identification-and then synthesize them into one parsimonious model. The consequences of different group emotions are reviewed and further constructs (including emotional aperture, group emotional intelligence, emotional culture, and emotional climate) are discussed. We end with a call for future research on several neglected group emotion topics including the study of discrete shared emotions, emotions at multiple levels, the effects of social network patterns, and effects on group functioning.","[Menges, Jochen I.] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Vallendar, Germany; [Kilduff, Martin] UCL, Dept Management Sci & Innovat, London WC1E 6BT, England","Menges, JI (reprint author), WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Vallendar, Germany.",jochen.menges@whu.edu,"Kilduff, Martin/A-4980-2012","Kilduff, Martin/0000-0003-4004-8749",,,,397,27,27,9,83,ACAD MANAGEMENT,BRIARCLIFF MANOR,"PACE UNIV, PO BOX 3020, 235 ELM RD, BRIARCLIFF MANOR, NY 10510-8020 USA",1941-6520,1941-6067,,ACAD MANAG ANN,Acad.

Behavioral data results showed that, in both the Duchenne smile and standard smile conditions, error rates were significantly lower than in the no-smile condition. The ERP analysis results indicated that, compared to the no-smile condition, both Duchenne and standard smiling facial expressions decreased ERN amplitude, and ERN amplitudes were smallest for those in the Duchenne smile condition.

Whereas some driving models partially address drivers' affective factors, the majority of them have focused on cognitive aspects. Thus, it would be helpful to construct an affect-integrated driving behaviour research model. First, I briefly assessed the current driving models and identified critical cognitive elements commonly found among those models. Next, the mechanisms of affective effects on those cognitive processes were described. Then, I showed the effects of affective states on driving performance. Finally, a conceptual model for affect-related driving behaviour research was proposed and followed by discussions from the theoretical and practical perspectives. This review helps researchers construct a more naturalistic and generic driving behaviour model, conceptualise affect detection research with a clearer idea of what affect needs to be detected and why, and develop an affect regulation model and adaptive system for multiple drivers. Relevance to human factors/ergonomics theory The present paper reviews affect-related driving research and proposes an affectintegrated driving model based on theoretical and practical evidence. This paper will contribute to conduct more comprehensive driving behaviour research and design an adaptive in-vehicle affect detection and mitigation system.","[Jeon, Myounghoon] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Cognit & Learning Sci, Mind Mus Machine Lab, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Jeon, Myounghoon] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA","Jeon, M (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Cognit & Learning Sci, Mind Mus Machine Lab, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",mjeon@mtu.edu,,,,,,220,2,2,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-922X,1464-536X,,THEOR ISS ERGON SCI,Theor.

Four experiments were conducted to investigate whether assimilation and accommodation can be induced or at least shifted by sensorimotor and cognitive manipulations. Experiment 1 investigated the relation between body manipulation and self-regulation. It was shown that assimilation could be triggered when participants were asked to hold on to golf balls as compared to being asked to drop them. Experiment 2 showed that a semantic priming of ""let go"" or ""hold on"" via instructions influenced the processes of self-regulation. Experiment 3 and Experiment 4 investigated the role of cognitive sets (divergent thinking) and motivational processes (thinking about one's action resources) in enhancing accommodation or assimilation. As expected, accommodation was triggered by an intervention activating divergent thought, and participants were more assimilative when they thought about their action resources. In sum, the results indicate that assimilation and accommodation can be induced experimentally; they were systematically dependent on physical, cognitive, and motivational states. The implications of the findings were discussed in the light of the dual-process model.","[Leipold, Bernhard; Bermeitinger, Christina; Greve, Werner; Meyer, Birgit; Arnold, Manuel; Pielniok, Marianna] Univ Hildesheim, Dept Psychol, D-31141 Hildesheim, Germany","Leipold, B (reprint author), Univ Hildesheim, Marienburger Pl 22, D-31141 Hildesheim, Germany.",leipold@uni-hildesheim.de,,,,,,48,5,5,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1747-0218,1747-0226,,Q J EXP PSYCHOL,Q.

Research shows these effects can occur by activating metaphor-associated knowledge constructs. This account is not sufficient, however, for explaining complementary effects-for example, the tendency to prefer social warmth when experiencing physical coldness (Experiment 1). We suggest that socially warm events are considered a means for achieving the goal of reducing physical coldness. Guided by this basic hypothesis and the principles of a goal systems framework, we examine whether the basic relationship between goals and means explains complementary embodiment effects. We find that socially warm activities are preferred over control activities when people are primed with the goal of reducing physical coldness, but not when primed with the concept of coldness (Experiment 2). We also find that activating an alternative goal decreases the attractiveness of socially warm activities when people are feeling cold (Experiment 3). Finally, we examine the effect of social coldness on preferences for physical warmth, showing that the attractiveness of physically warm items among socially excluded people is decreased by activating an alternative goal (Experiment 4). These results suggest that complementary embodiment effects follow the principles of goal activation.","[Zhang, Yan] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Business, Singapore 119245, Singapore; [Risen, Jane L.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Zhang, Y (reprint author), Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Business, 15 Kent Ridge Dr 8-22, Singapore 119245, Singapore.",yan.zhang@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,55,17,18,6,60,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

However, it has remained unclear whether approach and avoidance can actually change how people perceive the physical distance to valenced stimuli. Drawing on research on motivational orientation and valence as well as the motivated perception account, we predicted that valenced stimuli incompatible with motivational orientation would be perceived as closer than compatible stimuli because they motivate the goal of resolving the inconsistency arising from discrepant affective information. This prediction was supported in a series of 4 experiments. Findings were consistent across different manipulations of motivational orientation, including motor movements (Experiments 1 and 2) and cognitive procedures (Experiments 3 and 4), and across different types of stimuli, including abstract words (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) and photos of concrete objects (Experiment 3). Experiment 4 further investigated the mechanism behind the influence of incompatibility versus compatibility between motivational orientation and valence on distance perception. The findings showed that, relative to compatibility, incompatibility resulted in participants solving more anagrams, presumably because the goal-related motivational state gave rise to a general state of activation. Furthermore, perceptual estimates were correlated with the activity of the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and the activity of the Behavioral Activation System (BAS) relative to the BIS, further suggesting that goal-related motivation may be associated with perception. Overall, the present research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that visual perception is shaped by motivational considerations.","[Krpan, Dario; Schnall, Simone] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England","Krpan, D (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England.",dk413@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,86,6,6,3,31,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

A factorial analysis of this Musical Entrainment Questionnaire revealed a two-factor solution, with Visceral Entrainment (VE) corresponding to sensations of internal bodily entrainment and Motor Entrainment (ME) reflecting participants' inclination to move to the beat. These findings represent, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical evidence for the existence of two components underlying entrainment capable of predicting specific emotional responses to music.

However, the neural mechanisms of these initiating and modulating functions are unclear. In this study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and task-based fMRI to explore these processes by examining spontaneous cerebral activities and brain activations under two conditions: holding a pen using only the teeth (HPT: facilitating the muscles typically associated with smiling) and holding a pen using only the lips (HPL: inhibiting the muscles typically associated with smiling). The resting-state fMRI results showed that compared with the HPL condition, significant increases in the amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations were found in the right posterior cingulate gyrus [PCG; Brodmann area 31 (BA31)] and in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG; BA9) in the HPT condition. These findings might be related to the initiation of positive emotions (PCG) and to the control and allocation of attention (MFG). The task-based fMRI results showed that the inferior parietal lobule, left supplementary motor area, superior parietal lobule, precuneus, and bilateral middle cingulum were active when facial manipulation influenced the recognition of emotional facial expressions. These results demonstrate that facial actions might not only initiate a particular emotion and draw attention, but also influence face-based emotion recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Working with this assumption has led many emotions theorists to neglect the way in which emotions are simultaneously bodily and cognitive-evaluative. Even hybrid theories, such as those set forth by Prinz (2004) and Barlassina and Newen (2013), fail to account fully for how the cognitive and bodily elements of emotion are integrated. As a result, such accounts are unable to provide an adequate characterization of the intentionality or phenomenology of emotions. I will argue that an enactive account of emotions, one which characterizes them as a way of engaging with and making sense of one's surroundings, can help us to overcome this false dichotomy between cognitive and body elements. What I call 'affective framing' is at the core of emotional experience. It is the way in which we engage with and appraise our surroundings in and through bodily feelings of caring, so that the bodily and cognitive elements of emotion necessarily are fused. The notion of affective framing not only helps to clarify the relationship between bodily and cognitive elements of emotion, but also offers a useful way to make sense of both the intentional directedness and phenomenal character of emotional experience.","Emmanuel Coll, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Maiese, M (reprint author), Emmanuel Coll, 400 Fenway, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",maiesemi@emmanuel.edu,,,,,,41,10,10,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1568-7759,1572-8676,,PHENOMENOL COGN SCI,Phenomenol.

Using measures derived from outside observers, employees, family members, and cultural artifacts, we find that an emotional culture of companionate love at work positively relates to employees' satisfaction and teamwork and negatively relates to their absenteeism and emotional exhaustion. Employees' trait positive affectivity (trait PA)one's tendency to have a pleasant emotional engagement with one's environmentmoderates the influence of the culture of companionate love, amplifying its positive influence for employees higher in trait PA. We also find a positive association between a culture of companionate love and clients' outcomes, specifically, better patient mood, quality of life, satisfaction, and fewer trips to the emergency room. The study finds some association between a culture of love and families' satisfaction with the long-term care facility. We discuss the implications of a culture of companionate love for both cognitive and emotional theories of organizational culture. We also consider the relevance of a culture of companionate love in other industries and explore its managerial implications for the healthcare industry and beyond.","[Barsade, Sigal G.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [O'Neill, Olivia A.] George Mason Univ, Sch Business, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Barsade, SG (reprint author), Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 2000 Steinberg Dietrich Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",Barsade@wharton.upenn.edu; ooneill@gmu.edu,,,,,,187,55,55,13,115,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0001-8392,1930-3815,,ADMIN SCI QUART,Adm.

Evidence from driving studies has also emphasized the importance of driver situation awareness for performance and safety. However, to date, little research has investigated the relationship between emotional effects and driver situation awareness. In our experiment, 30 undergraduates drove in a simulator after induction of either anger or neutral affect. Results showed that an induced angry state can degrade driver situation awareness as well as driving performance as compared to a neutral state. However, the angry state did not have an impact on participants' subjective judgment or perceived workload, which might imply that the effects of anger occurred below their level of conscious awareness. One of the reasons participants showed a lack of compensation for their deficits in performance might be that they were not aware of severe impacts of emotional effects on driving performance.","[Jeon, Myounghoon] Michigan Technol Univ, Mind Mus Machine Lab, Dept Cognit & Learning Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Walker, Bruce N.; Gable, Thomas M.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Psychol, Sonificat Lab, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Jeon, M (reprint author), Michigan Technol Univ, Mind Mus Machine Lab, Dept Cognit & Learning Sci, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",mjeon@mtu.edu,,,,,,107,6,6,1,59,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1054-7460,1531-3263,,PRESENCE-TELEOP VIRT,Presence-Teleoper.

The present study sought to investigate the effects of sitting posture on the tendency of depressed individuals to recall a higher proportion of negative self-referent material. Thirty currently depressed inpatients either sat in a slumped (depressed) or in an upright (non-depressed) posture while imagining a visual scene of themselves in connection with positive or depression related words presented to them on a computer screen. An incidental recall test of these words was conducted after a distraction task. Results of a mixed ANOVA showed a significant posture x word type interaction, with upright-sitting patients showing unbiased recall of positive and negative words but slumped patients showing recall biased towards more negative words. The findings indicate that relatively minor changes in the motoric system can affect one of the best-documented cognitive biases in depression. Practical implications of the findings are discussed.

We put forward our theory by contrasting it with Prinz's (2004) pure somatic theory, according to which emotions are entirely constituted by bodily perceptions. After illustrating Prinz's theory and discussing the evidence in its favor, we show that it is beset by serious problems-i.e., it gets the neural correlates of emotion wrong, it isn't able to distinguish emotions from bodily perceptions that aren't emotions, it cannot account for emotions being directed towards particular objects, and it mischaracterizes emotion phenomenology. We argue that our theory accounts for the empirical evidence considered by Prinz and solves the problems faced by his theory. In particular, we maintain that our theory gives a unified and principled account of the relation between emotions and bodily perceptions, the intentionality of emotions, and emotion phenomenology.","[Barlassina, Luca; Newen, Albert] Ruhr Univ Bochum, D-44780 Bochum, Germany","Barlassina, L (reprint author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Philosophie 2, GA3-39,Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",luca.barlassina@gmail.com,,,,,,54,15,15,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-8205,1933-1592,,PHILOS PHENOMEN RES,Philos.

It is hypothesized that this includes facial emotion recognition but limited knowledge exists about possible neural correlates of this assumed deficit. We hence tested thirty-seven healthy subjects with either a relatively high or low degree of alexithymia (HDA versus LDA), who performed in a reliable and standardized test of facial emotion recognition (FEEL Facially Expressed Emotion Labeling) in the functional MRI. LDA subjects had significantly better emotion recognition scores and showed relatively more activity in several brain areas associated with alexithymia and emotional awareness (anterior cingulate cortex), and the extended system of facial perception concerned with aspects of social communication and emotion (amygdala, insula, striatum). Additionally, LDA subjects had more activity in the visual area of social perception (posterior part of the superior temporal sulcus) and the inferior frontal cortex. HDA subjects, on the other hand, exhibited greater activity in the superior parietal lobule. With differences in behaviour and brain responses between two groups of otherwise healthy subjects, our results indirectly support recent conceptualizations and epidemiological data, that alexithymia is a dimensional personality trait apparent in clinically healthy subjects rather than a categorical diagnosis only applicable to clinical populations.

But how do people deal with it? To date, most research has focused on the cognitive strategies people adopt to do so. In four experiments we examine, whether people may also use an alternative experiential route to cope with uncertainty. We demonstrate that (1) when faced with uncertainty, people seek soft haptic sensations (Experiments 1 and 2) and (2) that doing so is functional (Experiments 3 and 4). More specifically, we show that people shift their preference to objects with soft (i.e., soft-grip pen, soft candy) rather than hard properties (i.e., hard-grip pen, hard candy) when feeling uncertain. Furthermore, we show that holding something soft (i.e., a soft-grip pen, a soft cloth) as compared to something hard (i.e., a hard-grip pen, a hard cloth) reduces uncertainty on a subsequent ambiguous task and helps to shield against uncertainty in daily life by increasing tolerance toward uncertainty. Overall, this research reveals that humans may use their oldest and most fundamental sense touch as a basic experiential device to cope with uncertainty. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We examined the ways crewmembers of a 520-day simulated spaceflight to Mars (held in the Institute for Biomedical Problems, in Moscow) experienced and regulated their moods and emotions. Results show that crewmembers experienced predominantly positive emotions throughout their 520-day isolation and the changes in mood of the crewmembers were asynchronous and balanced. The study suggests that during the simulation, crewmembers experienced and regulated their emotions differently than they usually do in their everyday life. In isolation, crewmembers preferred to suppress and neutralize their negative emotions and express overtly only emotions with positive valence. Although the affective processes were almost invariable throughout the simulation, two periods of time when the level of positive emotions declined were identified. Regarding the findings, the paper suggests that changes in positive affectivity could be a more valuable indicator of human experience in demanding but professional environments than changes in negative affectivity.

It is crucial in experiencing emotions, in forming attitudes and in regulating emotions and behavior. This paper investigates effects of dynamic body feedback on affect and attitudes, focusing on the impact of movement rhythms with smooth vs. sharp reversals as one basic category of movement qualities. It relates those qualities to already explored effects of approach vs. avoidance motor behavior as one basic category of movement shape. Studies 1 and 2 tested the effects of one of two basic movement qualities (smooth vs. sharp rhythms) on affect and cognition. The third study tested those movement qualities in combination with movement shape (approach vs. avoidance motor behavior) and the effects of those combinations on affect and attitudes toward initially valence-free stimuli. Results suggest that movement rhythms influence affect (studies 1 and 2), and attitudes (study 3), and moderate the impact of approach and avoidance motor behavior on attitudes (study 3). Extending static body feedback research with a dynamic account, findings indicate that movement qualities next to movement shape play an important role, when movement of the lived body is an independent variable.","[Koch, Sabine C.] SRH Univ Heidelberg, D-69123 Heidelberg, Germany; [Koch, Sabine C.] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany","Koch, SC (reprint author), SRH Univ Heidelberg, Maria Probst Str 3, D-69123 Heidelberg, Germany.",sabine.koch@hochschule-heidelberg.de,,,,,,69,16,16,0,20,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

On this background, a framework model of embodied affectivity(1) is suggested: we regard emotions as resulting from the circular interaction between affective qualities or affordances in the environment and the subject's bodily resonance, be it in the form of sensations, postures, expressive movements or movement tendencies. Motion and emotion are thus intrinsically connected: one is moved by movement (perception; impression; affection(2)) and moved to move (action; expression; e-motion). Through its resonance, the body functions as a medium of emotional perception: it colors or charges self-experience and the environment with affective valences while it remains itself in the background of one's own awareness. This model is then applied to emotional social understanding or interaffectivity which is regarded as an intertwinement of two cycles of embodied affectivity, thus continuously modifying each partner's affective affordances and bodily resonance. We conclude with considerations of how embodied affectivity is altered in psychopathology and can be addressed in psychotherapy of the embodied self.","[Fuchs, Thomas] Univ Clin Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; [Koch, Sabine C.] SRH Univ Heidelberg, Dept Therapeut Sci, D-69123 Heidelberg, Germany","Koch, SC (reprint author), SRH Univ Heidelberg, Movement Therapy Dept, Maria Probst Str 3, D-69123 Heidelberg, Germany.",sabine.koch@hochschule-heidelberg.de,,,,,,103,67,67,3,52,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

It has repeatedly received criticism due to a focus on demonstration studies. Here, I aim to identify some of the possible reasons underlying the lack of theoretical progress. First, I warn against relying too strongly on inductive inferences due to the weak empirical support for social embodiment findings. Second, I will discuss two dominant theoretical frameworks in social embodiment research (conceptual metaphor theory and perceptual symbol systems theory) in light of their potential to inspire empirically testable hypotheses. Finally, I propose that one way to turn social embodiment research into a progressive research line is to integrate it more firmly with past theoretical work in social cognition, and to focus on understanding the contexts in which concrete cues in the environment are salient and accessible enough to influence social inferences.","Eindhoven Univ Technol, IPO 133, Human Technol Interact Grp, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands","Lakens, D (reprint author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, IPO 133, Human Technol Interact Grp, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.",D.Lakens@tue.nl,"Lakens, Daniel/K-3831-2015","Lakens, Daniel/0000-0002-0247-239X",,,,94,13,13,0,22,GUILFORD PUBLICATIONS INC,NEW YORK,"370 SEVENTH AVE, SUITE 1200, NEW YORK, NY 10001-1020 USA",0278-016X,,,SOC COGNITION,Soc.

When people articulate different consonants (e. g., B or K) they press the tongue and the lips against various spots in the mouth. This allows for construction of words that feature systematic wanderings of consonantal stricture spots either from the front to the rear (inward; e.g., BENOKA) or from the rear to the front (outward; e. g., KENOBA) of the mouth. These wanderings of muscular strictures resemble the oral kinematics during either deglution (swallowing-like, inward movement) or expectoration (spitting-like, outward movement). Thus, we predicted that the articulation of inward and outward words induces motivational states associated with deglutition and expectoration-namely, approach and avoidance-which was tested in 9 experiments (total N = 822). Inward words were preferred over outward words, being labeled as nonsense words (Experiments 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9), company names (Experiment 2), or person names (Experiments 3, 7, and 8), with control words falling in between (Experiment 5). As a social-behavioral consequence, ostensible chat partners were more often chosen to interact with when having inward compared to outward names (Experiment 7). The effect was found in German-speaking (Experiments 1-5) and English-speaking (Experiment 6) samples, and it occurred even under silent reading (all experiments) and for negatively labeled targets (names of villains; Experiment 8). Showing articulation simulations as being the causal undercurrent, this effect was absent in aphasia patients who lacked covert subvocalizations (Experiment 9).","[Topolinski, Sascha] Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Maschmann, Ira Theresa] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Wurzburg, Germany; [Pecher, Diane] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Winkielman, Piotr] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA","Topolinski, S (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol Social & Econ Cognit 2, Richard Strauss Str 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.",sascha.topolinski@uni-koeln.de,,"Winkielman, Piotr/0000-0003-2330-1802",,,,87,38,38,2,23,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

Participants imagining intergroup contact expressed more positive attitudes towards an outgroup when they could physically mimic a positive affective state by smiling, but there was no such effect when embodiment was constrained.

I find that an overwhelming majority of people believe trying to calm down is the best way to cope with pre-performance anxiety. However, across several studies involving karaoke singing, public speaking, and math performance, I investigate an alternative strategy: reappraising anxiety as excitement. Compared with those who attempt to calm down, individuals who reappraise their anxious arousal as excitement feel more excited and perform better. Individuals can reappraise anxiety as excitement using minimal strategies such as self-talk (e. g., saying ""I am excited"" out loud) or simple messages (e. g., ""get excited""), which lead them to feel more excited, adopt an opportunity mind-set (as opposed to a threat mind-set), and improve their subsequent performance.

Starting from the general hypothesis that crying is a self-soothing behavior, we consider different mechanisms through which these effects may appear. In the first section, we briefly explain the main functions of human crying. Then we define self-soothing in terms of homeostatic processes of mood regulation and stress reduction and we underline the importance of distinguishing self-soothing effects of crying from social-soothing that it may elicit. We then provide a comprehensive review of the putative mood-enhancing and -relieving effects of crying and their variations stemming from characteristics of crying person, antecedents, manifestations, and social consequences of crying. We also discuss the possible methodological explanations for the seemingly discrepant findings regarding mood improvement and relief that may follow crying. We then provide theoretical and empirical support for our general hypothesis that crying is a self-soothing behavior by presenting and evaluating the possible physiological, cognitive, and behavioral mechanisms that may play a mediating role in the relationship between crying and homeostatic regulation that includes mood improvement and relief. Starting from the idea that social-soothing and self-soothing mechanisms share the same physiological systems, we propose that biological processes act in parallel with learning and reappraisal processes that accompany crying, which results in homeostatic regulation. Given the parallels between self-soothing behaviors in humans and animals, we also propose that crying might self-soothe through a mechanism that shares key properties with rhythmical, stereotypic behaviors. We conclude that, in addition to the importance of socially mediated mechanisms for the mood-enhancing effects of crying, there is converging evidence for the direct, self-soothing effects of crying.","[Gracanin, Asmir] Univ Rijeka, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Psychol, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Bylsma, Lauren M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Vingerhoets, Ad J.

While facial EMG over the Corrugator supercilii and the Zygomaticus major was measured, each participant performed two tasks with pictures of album covers. One task was an affective evaluation task and the other was to attribute the album covers to one of five decades. The Embodied Emotion Account predicts that valence concordant EMG is more likely to occur if the task necessitates a somatosensory simulation of the evaluative meaning of stimuli. Results support this prediction with regard to Corrugator supercilii in that valence concordant EMG activity was only present in the affective evaluation task but not in the non-evaluative task. Results for the Zygomaticus major were ambiguous. Our findings are in line with the view that EMG activity is an embodied part of the evaluation process and not a mere physical outcome.","[Weinreich, Andre; Funcke, Jakob Maria] Humboldt Univ, Dept Psychol, D-10099 Berlin, Germany","Weinreich, A (reprint author), Humboldt Univ, Dept Psychol, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",a.weinreich@psychologie.hu-berlin.de,,,,,,26,8,8,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0269-9931,1464-0600,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

Here, we investigated whether the processing of brief fear stimuli is selectively gated by their timing in relation to individual heartbeats. Emotional and neutral faces were presented to human volunteers at cardiac systole, when ejection of blood from the heart causes arterial baroreceptors to signal centrally the strength and timing of each heartbeat, and at diastole, the period between heartbeats when baroreceptors are quiescent. Participants performed behavioral and neuroimaging tasks to determine whether these interoceptive signals influence the detection of emotional stimuli at the threshold of conscious awareness and alter judgments of emotionality of fearful and neutral faces. Our results show that fearful faces were detected more easily and were rated as more intense at systole than at diastole. Correspondingly, amygdala responses were greater to fearful faces presented at systole relative to diastole. These novel findings highlight a major channel by which short-term interoceptive fluctuations enhance perceptual and evaluative processes specifically related to the processing of fear and threat and counter the view that baroreceptor afferent signaling is always inhibitory to sensory perception.","[Garfinkel, Sarah N.; Minati, Ludovico; Critchley, Hugo D.] Univ Sussex, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Falmer BN1 9RR, England; [Garfinkel, Sarah N.; Seth, Anil K.; Critchley, Hugo D.] Univ Sussex, Sackler Ctr Consciousness Sci, Falmer BN1 9RR, E Sussex, England; [Minati, Ludovico] Fdn IRCCs, Inst Neurol Besta, Sci Dept, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Gray, Marcus A.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Adv Imaging, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Seth, Anil K.] Univ Sussex, Dept Informat, Falmer BN1 9QJ, England; [Dolan, Raymond J.] UCL, Wellcome Trust, Ctr Neuroimaging, London WC1N 3BG, England","Garfinkel, SN (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Clin Imaging Sci Ctr, Falmer BN1 9RR, England.",s.garfinkel@bsms.ac.uk,"Minati, Ludovico/R-1076-2017; Gray, Marcus/F-6521-2013","Minati, Ludovico/0000-0002-2532-1674; Gray, Marcus/0000-0001-8671-6939; Dolan, Ray/0000-0001-9356-761X; Garfinkel, Sarah/0000-0002-5961-1012; Seth, Anil/0000-0002-1421-6051; critchley, hugo/0000-0002-2445-9284",European Research Council [CCFIB AG 234150]; Wellcome Trust; European Union [258749]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Leadership [EP/G007543/1]; Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G007543/1],"This work was supported by the Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation.

However in the lying body position, the associations of arm flexion/extension to approach/avoidance motor action are converse. Therefore, there is an opposite prediction for the effect of arm posture on creative thinking. The study reported here asked the participants to work on Alternative Uses Task (AUT) problems while performing arm flexion and arm extension, in the body contexts of being seated on a chair or lying in bed. The results demonstrated that arm flexion and extension in the lying body position exerted effects on AUT performance in a converse pattern compared to that in the seated body position.

To determine the antidepressant effect of onabotulinumtoxinA (OBA) treatment of corrugator and procerus muscles in people with major depressive disorder, we conducted a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. In an outpatient clinical research center, eighty-five subjects with DSM-IV major depression were randomized to receive either OBA (29 units for females and 40 units for males) or saline injections into corrugator and procerus frown muscles (74 subjects were entered into the analysis). Subjects were rated at screening, and 3 and 6 weeks after OBA treatment. The primary outcome measure was the response rate, as defined by >= 50% decrease in score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Response rates at 6 weeks from the date of injection were 52% and 15% in the OBA and placebo groups, respectively (Chi-Square (1) = 11.2, p < 0.001, Fisher p < 0.001). The secondary outcome measure of remission rate (MADRS score of 10 or less) was 27% with OBA and 7% with placebo (Chi-square (1) = 5.1, p < 0.02, Fisher p < 0.03). Six weeks after a single treatment, MADRS scores of subjects were reduced on average by 47% in those given OBA, and by 21% in those given placebo (Mann-Whitney U, p < 0.0005). In conclusion, a single treatment with OBA to the corrugator and procerus muscles appears to induce a significant and sustained antidepressant effect in patients with major depression.

These techniques are relatively simple exercises that allow happiness seekers to mimic thoughts and behavior of naturally happy people, in order to increase their level of well-being. Because research has shown that the joint use of these exercises increases their effects, practitioners who want to help happiness seekers need validated interventions that combine several of these techniques. To meet this need, we have developed and tested an integrative intervention (Positive Emotion Regulation program -PER program) incorporating a number of validated techniques structured around a theoretical model: the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation. To test the effectiveness of this program and to identify its added value relative to existing interventions, 113 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to a 6-week positive emotion regulation pilot program, a loving-kindness meditation training program, or a wait-list control group. Results indicate that fewer participants dropped out from the PER program than from the Loving-Kindness Meditation training. Furthermore, subjects in the PER group showed a significant increase in subjective well-being and life satisfaction and a significant decrease in depression and physical symptoms when compared to controls. Our results suggest that the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation can be an effective option to organize and deliver positive integrative interventions.","[Weytens, Fanny; Luminet, Olivier; Mikolajczak, Moira] Catholic Univ Louvain, Res Inst Psychol Sci, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Weytens, Fanny; Luminet, Olivier] Natl Fund Sci Res FRS FNRS, Brussels, Belgium; [Verhofstadt, Lesley L.] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Weytens, F (reprint author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Res Inst Psychol Sci, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",fanny.weytens@uclouvain.be,,"Mikolajczak, Moira/0000-0002-7333-1578",Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique de Belgique (FRS-FNRS) [1.1.874.13],"Fanny Weytens is supported by grant 1.1.874.13 from the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique de Belgique (FRS-FNRS, www.frs-fnrs.be).

Within marketing, the field of sensory marketing has developed which explores the role of the senses in consumer behavior. In psychology, the dominant computer metaphor of information processing has been challenged by researchers demonstrating various manners in which mental activity is grounded in sensory experience. These findings are arduous to explain using the amodal model of the human mind. In this introduction, we first delineate key assumptions of the information processing paradigm and then discuss some of the key conceptual challenges posed by the research generally appearing under the titles of embodiment, grounded cognition, or sensory marketing. We then address the use of bodily feelings as a source of information; next, we turn to the role of context sensitive perception, imagery, and simulation in consumer behavior, and finally discuss the role of metaphors.

We hypothesized that the mood-lifting effect was mediated by facial feedback mechanisms. Here we assessed if agitation, which may be associated with increased dynamic psychomotor activity of the facial musculature, can predict response to the treatment. To test this hypothesis, we re-analyzed the data of the scales from our previous study on a single item basis and compared the baseline scores in the agitation item (item 9) of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) between responders (n = 9) and participants who did not attain response (n = 6) among the recipients of onabotulinumtoxinA (n = 15). Responders had significantly igher item 9 scores at baseline [1.56 + 0.88 vs. 0.33 + 0.52, t((13)) = 3.04, d = 1.7, p = 0.01], while no other single item of the HAM-D or the Beck Depression Inventory was associated with treatment response. The agitation score had an overall precision of 78% in predicting response in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (area under the curve, AUC = 0.87). These data provide a link between response to botulinum toxin treatment with a psychomotor manifestation of depression and thereby indirect support of the proposed facial feedback mechanism of action. Moreover, it suggests that patients with agitated depression may particularly benefit from botulinum toxin treatment.","[Wollmer, M.

In Experiments 2 and 3, participants rated true and false smiles either while wearing mouthguards or when allowed to freely mimic the smiles with or without additional distraction, namely holding a squeeze ball or wearing a finger-cuff heart rate monitor.

High-resolution measures of heart rate, heart rate variability, continuous blood pressure, and respiration were recorded, and the phase synchronization among the variables was analyzed, which provides information on the coordinated behavior of response systems. Viewing humorous films had cardiovascular effects indicating heightened sympathetic arousal, if they elicited intense amusement. No effects were observed for variables indicating parasympathetic input to the heart. The observed effects associated with amusement were not driven by changes in the respiration. The suppression of positive affect expressions did not produce any additional activation. The transient cardiovascular effects of amusement do not correspond to beneficial correlates of a habitual positive affect disposition reported in the literature, demonstrating that it would be erroneous to argue from the long-term effects of a positive affect disposition to the effects of a single amusing event.","[Lackner, Helmut K.; Weiss, Elisabeth M.; Papousek, Ilona] Graz Univ, Dept Psychol, Biol Psychol Unit, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Lackner, Helmut K.; Hinghofer-Szalkay, Helmut] Med Univ Graz, Inst Physiol, Graz, Austria","Lackner, HK (reprint author), Graz Univ, Dept Psychol, Biol Psychol Unit, Univ Pl 2 DG, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",h.lackner@uni-graz.at; e.weiss@uni-graz.at; helmut.hinghofer@medunigraz.at; ilona.papousek@uni-graz.at,,"Papousek, Ilona/0000-0002-6620-0318",,,,50,12,12,2,31,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1090-0586,1573-3270,,APPL PSYCHOPHYS BIOF,Appl.

We argue that non-emotional gestures can prime the abstract concept of honesty. Four studies demonstrated that the emblematic gesture associated with honesty (putting a hand on one's heart) increased the level of honesty perceived by others, and increased the honesty shown in one's own behavior. Target persons performing this gesture were described in terms associated with honesty, and appeared more trustworthy to others than when the same targets were photographed with a control gesture. Persons performing the hand-over-heart gesture provided more honest assessments of others' attractiveness, and refrained from cheating, as compared to persons performing neutral gestures. These findings suggest that bodily experience associated with abstract concepts can influence both one's perceptions of others, and one's own complex actions.

Experiment 1 showed that an implicit affect task (positive subliminal evaluative conditioning) led to increases in signature size relative to an affectively neutral task, showing that implicit affective cues alter signature size. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated increases in signature size following experiential self-focus on sensory and affective stimuli relative to both conceptual self-focus and external (non-self-focus) in both healthy participants and patients with anorexia nervosa, a disorder associated with self-evaluation and a sense of disembodiment. In all three experiments, increases in signature size were unrelated to changes in self-reported mood and larger than manipulation unrelated variations. Conclusions: Together, these findings suggest that a person's sense of embodiment is reflected in their signature size.","[Rawal, Adhip] Univ Sussex, Sch Psychol, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Harmer, Catherine J.; Park, Rebecca J.; Williams, J.

Recent clinical trials suggest that BTX treatment of muscles involved in the development of negative emotions may also have an antidepressant effect. This article gives a systematic review of the literature regarding BTX in the treatment of major depression. Methods: We screened the databases of Medline and Scopus using the search terms [(""botulinum toxin"" OR ""botox"") AND (""antidepressant"" OR ""depression"" OR ""depressed"")]. The website www.clinicaltrials.gov was screened with the same search terms in order to detect current studies. Results: As of April 2013, we identified 3 studies that evaluated the antidepressant effects of BTX in the treatment of major depression. An improvement in mood after treatment with BTX was seen in a case series of 10 depressed patients. In a randomised, placebo-controlled study of thirty patients assigned to a verum (BTX, n = 15) or placebo (saline, n = 15) group, treatment with BTX has also shown a positive effect onmood. Another prospective, open-label study evaluated the antidepressive effect of BTX in 25 subjects with major depression. On www.clinicaltrials.gov we identified 2 ongoing studies, which are currently investigating the antidepressant effect of BTX. Conclusion: Recently published studies have shown a reduction of depressive symptoms after treatment of the glabellar frown lines with BTX injections. Further clinical studies in larger patient samples are necessary to prove the efficacy and safety of BTX injections used for the treatment of depressive disorders.","[Hawlik, A. E.; Freudenmann, R.

Across 4 studies, we found that participants who wore a heavy backpack experienced higher levels of guilt compared to those who wore a light backpack. Additionally, wearing a heavy backpack affected participants' behavior. Specifically, it led them to be more likely to choose healthy snacks over guilt-inducing ones and boring tasks over fun ones. It also led participants to cheat less. Importantly, self-reported guilt mediated the effect of wearing a heavy backpack on these behaviors. Our studies also examined the mechanism behind these effects and demonstrated that participants processed guilty stimuli more fluently when experiencing physical weight.","[Kouchaki, Maryam] Harvard Univ, Edmond J Safra Ctr Eth, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gino, Francesca] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jami, Ata] Univ Cent Florida, Coll Business Adm, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","Kouchaki, M (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Edmond J Safra Ctr Eth, 124 Mt Auburn St,Suite 520N, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mkouchaki@ethics.harvard.edu,,,,,,45,16,16,1,30,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0096-3445,1939-2222,,J EXP PSYCHOL GEN,J.

In five experiments, participants (n = 701) were shown two silhouettes of bodies alongside emotional words, stories, movies, or facial expressions. They were asked to color the bodily regions whose activity they felt increasing or decreasing while viewing each stimulus. Different emotions were consistently associated with statistically separable bodily sensation maps across experiments. These maps were concordant across West European and East Asian samples. Statistical classifiers distinguished emotion-specific activation maps accurately, confirming independence of topographies across emotions. We propose that emotions are represented in the somatosensory system as culturally universal categorical somatotopic maps.

We demonstrate that the true semantics of the value, which a service aims to create for its adopter, resides in the social and bodily being of the adopter. Situating the adopter in her interactions with the external-world helps identify the different responsibilities that the adopter, and other entities occurring in that situation, can undertake in realizing the service. At the same time, embodying the adopter helps acknowledge the role of bodily states in mediating the effect a situation has in terms of the appreciation it invokes at the adopter. We provide a set of four force-dynamic patterns that model this mediation, thereby helping service-designers identify situations that best implement the features required to invoke the desired appreciation.","[Saxena, Anshuman] I&C EPFL, LAMS, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Saxena, Anshuman] TATA Consultancy Serv, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Wegmann, Alain] I&C EPFL, LAMS, Lausanne, Switzerland","Saxena, A (reprint author), I&C EPFL, LAMS, Lausanne, Switzerland.",anshuman.saxena@epfl.ch; alain.wegmann@epfl.ch,,,,,,39,0,0,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1060-3425,,978-1-4799-2504-9,P ANN HICSS,,,2014,,,,,,,1241,1250,,10.1109/HICSS.2014.161,,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,BB5FW,WOS:000343806601043,,,,,4/26/19

Recent scholarship in affect and neuroscience reveals that cognitive and verbal strategies, while privileged in democratic politics, are often insufficient to cultivate the receptivity that constitutes the most basic premise of democratic encounters. This article draws on this scholarship and a recent case of forum theatre to examine the conditions of receptivity and responsiveness, and identify specific strategies that foster such conditions. It argues that the forms of encounter most effective in cultivating receptivity are those that move us via affective intensity within pointedly mediated contexts. It is this constellation of strategies-this strange marriage of immersion and mediation-that enabled this performance to surface latent memory, affect and bias, unsettle entrenched patterns of thought and behaviour, and provide the conditions for revisability. This case makes clear that to lie beyond the domain of cognitive and verbal processes is not to lie beyond potential intervention, and offers insight to how such receptivity might be achieved in political processes more broadly.","[Beausoleil, Emily] Massey Univ, Sch People Environm & Planning, Palmerston North, New Zealand","Beausoleil, E (reprint author), Massey Univ PN331, Sch People Environm & Planning, Private Bag 11 222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand.",e.beausoleil@massey.ac.nz,"Beausoleil, Emily/E-8299-2018","Beausoleil, Emily/0000-0002-7923-3514",,,,106,6,6,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1654-4951,1654-6369,,ETHICS GLOB POLIT,Ethics Glob.

In addition, a control condition was included in which participants read the text naturally (without a manipulation of facial posture). The influence of emotion simulation on discourse understanding was assessed by online (self-paced reading times) and offline (verbatim and inference questions) measures of comprehension. The major result was that participants read faster the target text describing positive emotional events while their bodily systems were prepared for processing of positive emotions (matching condition) rather than unprepared (control condition) or prevented from positive emotional processing (mismatching condition). Simulation of positive emotions did not have a significant impact on offline explicit and implicit discourse comprehension.

Accordingly, differentiating between the self and others is beneficial for perspective taking because it highlights the inadequacy of egocentric anchoring. The current research tested whether activating avoidance motivational orientation enhances perspective-taking performance (compared to approach motivational orientation), because self-other differentiation is facilitated under avoidance orientation. Supporting these predictions, two experiments showed that inducing avoidance motivational orientation (compared to approach orientation) either via goal framing or via the respective arm position enhances perspective-taking performance. Using experimental causal chain design, Study 3a supported the hypothesis that avoidance motivational orientation fosters self-other differentiation, while Study 3b showed that fostering self-other differentiation experimentally enhanced perspective-taking performance.

It has been proposed that facial mimicry contributes to emotion recognition of and emotional response to facial expressions. This study investigated whether BPD patients differ in facial reactions, emotion recognition and their subjective emotional response to faces showing different emotional expressions. Method: Twenty-eight female BPD patients and 28 healthy controls underwent a facial recognition task with dynamic facial pictures while facial muscle activity (occipitofrontalis, corrugator supercilii, levator labii superioris, zygomaticus major and orbicularis oculi) was recorded. Furthermore, participants rated the emotional intensity of the presented faces and the intensity of their subjective feeling of this emotion. Results: Compared to controls, BPD patients showed enhanced responses of the corrugator supercilii muscle in response to angry, sad and disgusted facial expressions, and attenuated responses of the levator labii superioris in response to happy and surprised faces. There were no overall group differences regarding emotion recognition performance or intensity ratings. Conclusion: These results do not support the view that facial recognition in BPD is impaired or that there is a general hypersensitivity to the emotional state of others. Instead, they suggest a negativity bias in BPD, expressed by reduced facial responding to positive social signals and increased facial responding to negative social signals. This is a pattern of facial reactions that might contribute to the difficulties in social interactions frequently reported by patients with this disorder. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

The current research tested three potential sources of priming effects in the AMP: affective feelings, semantic concepts, and prepotent motor responses. Ruling out prepotent motor responses as a driving force, priming effects on evaluative and semantic target responses occurred regardless of whether the key assignment in the task was fixed or random. Moreover, priming effects emerged for affect-eliciting primes in the absence of semantic knowledge about the primes. Finally, priming effects were independent of the order in which primes and targets were presented, suggesting that AMP effects are driven by misattribution rather than biased perceptions of the targets. Taken together, these results support accounts that attribute priming effects in the AMP to a general misattribution mechanism that can operate on either affective feelings or semantic concepts.","[Gawronski, Bertram; Ye, Yang] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada","Gawronski, B (reprint author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Psychol, Social Sci Ctr, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",bgawrons@uwo.ca,,,,,,41,43,44,1,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0146-1672,1552-7433,,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

Enhancing facial expressiveness produces an increase in autonomic arousal and self-reported emotional experience, whereas limiting facial expression attenuates these responses. The present study investigated differences in autonomic responses during imitated versus observed facial expressions. Thus, we obtained the facial electromyogram (EMG) of the corrugator muscle, and measured the skin conductance response (SCR) and pupil size (PS) of participants while they were either imitating or simply observing emotional expressions of anger. We found that participants produced significantly greater responses across all three measures (EMG, SCR, and PS) during active imitation than during passive observation. These results show that amplified feedback from facial muscles during imitation strengthens, sympathetic activation in response to negative emotional cues. Our findings suggest that manipulations of muscular feedback could be used to modulate the bodily expression of emotion, including autonomic responses to the emotional cues. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We contribute to this venture by capitalizing on recent work in cognitive science analyzing response dynamics, which shows that the bearing information processing dynamics have on intended action is also revealed in the motor system. This decidedly ""embodied"" view suggests that researchers are missing out on potential dependent variables with which to evaluate their models-those associated with the motor response that produces a choice. The current work develops a method for collecting and analyzing such data in the domain of decision making. We first validate this method using widely normed stimuli from the International Affective Picture System (Experiment 1), and demonstrate that curvature in response trajectories provides a metric of the competition between choice options. We next extend the method to risky decision making (Experiment 2) and develop predictions for three popular classes of process model. The data provided by response dynamics demonstrate that choices contrary to the maxim of risk seeking in losses and risk aversion in gains may be the product of at least one ""online"" preference reversal, and can thus begin to discriminate amongst the candidate models. Finally, we incorporate attentional data collected via eye-tracking (Experiment 3) to develop a formal computational model of joint information sampling and preference accumulation. In sum, we validate response dynamics for use in preferential choice tasks and demonstrate the unique conclusions afforded by response dynamics over and above traditional methods.

Experiments 3 and 4 were similar to the previous experiments, but the experimental materials were emotionally laden images. In Experiment 5 and 6 the same bodily manipulation used throughout the previous experiments was kept while participants judged facial expressions. The first pair of experiments replicated findings suggesting that sensorimotor systems are activated during the processing of emotionally laden language. However, follow-up experiments suggested that dual activation of both perceptual and motor systems is not always necessary. For the particular case of emotionally laden stimuli, results suggested that the perceptual system seems to drive the processing. It is also shown that a high resonance between sensorimotor properties afforded by the stimuli and the sensorimotor systems activated in the cogniser elicit emotional states. The results invite to review radical versions of embodiment accounts and rather support a graded-embodiment view.","[Marmolejo-Ramos, Fernando] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Marmolejo-Ramos, Fernando; Dunn, John] Univ Adelaide, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Psychol, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia","Marmolejo-Ramos, F (reprint author), Univ Adelaide, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Psychol, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",fernando.marmolejoramos@adelaide.edu,,"Marmolejo-Ramos, Fernando/0000-0003-4680-1287",,,,92,6,7,2,8,"PONTIFICA UNIV JAVERIANA, FAC PSYCH",BOGOTA,"CARRERA 5 NUM 39-00, EDIFICIO MANUEL BRICENO, BOGOTA, 00000, COLOMBIA",1657-9267,,,UNIV PSYCHOL,Univ.

The first three experiments showed that individuals who assumed expansive postures (either consciously or inadvertently) were more likely to steal money, cheat on a test, and commit traffic violations in a driving simulation. Results suggested that participants' self-reported sense of power mediated the link between postural expansiveness and dishonesty. Study 4 revealed that automobiles with more expansive driver's seats were more likely to be illegally parked on New York City streets.

In Study 4, individuals who were randomly assigned to physically expand a representation of their self-concept reported greater self-efficacy at resolving potential problems than those who contracted a self-representation or left it unchanged. Taken together, these four studies provide the first empirical evidence that expanded self-concepts lead to greater self-efficacy.","[Mattingly, Brent A.] Ashland Univ, Dept Psychol, Ashland, OH 44805 USA; [Lewandowski, Gary W., Jr.] Monmouth Univ, Dept Psychol, West Long Branch, NJ USA","Mattingly, BA (reprint author), Ashland Univ, Dept Psychol, 401 Coll Ave, Ashland, OH 44805 USA.",bmatting@ashland.edu,,,,,,34,16,17,1,23,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND",1529-8868,,,SELF IDENTITY,Self Identity,1-Nov,2013,12,6,,,,,621,634,,10.1080/15298868.2012.718863,,,,14,"Psychology, Social",Psychology,223ZQ,WOS:000324851400004,,,,,4/26/19

In natural environments, representations are tightly coupled to task. Objects that are task-relevant are remembered better due to a combination of increased selection for fixation and strategic control of encoding and/or retaining viewed information. However, it is not understood how physically manipulating objects when performing a natural task influences priorities for selection and memory. In this study, we compare priorities for selection and memory when actively engaged in a natural task with first-person observation of the same object manipulations. Results suggest that active manipulation of a task-relevant object results in a specific prioritization for object position information compared with other properties and compared with action observation of the same manipulations. Experiment 2 confirms that this spatial prioritization is likely to arise from manipulation rather than differences in spatial representation in real environments and the movies used for action observation. Thus, our findings imply that physical manipulation of task relevant objects results in a specific prioritization of spatial information about task-relevant objects, possibly coupled with strategic de-prioritization of colour memory for irrelevant objects.","[Tatler, Benjamin W.; Hirose, Yoriko; Finnegan, Sarah K.; Pievilainen, Riina; Kirtley, Clare; Kennedy, Alan] Univ Dundee, Sch Psychol, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland","Tatler, BW (reprint author), Univ Dundee, Sch Psychol, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",b.w.tatler@dundee.ac.uk,,"Tatler, Benjamin/0000-0002-5316-766X",Leverhulme Trust [F00143O],This research was supported by a research grant awarded to B.

To address this issue, we recorded experiential, behavioral, and physiological responses while participants watched negative and positive pictures. Cross-correlations were used to quantify emotion coherence. Study 1 tested how two types of suppression (expressive and physiological) influence coherence. Results showed that both strategies decreased the response coherence measured in negative and positive contexts. Study 2 tested how multichannel suppression (simultaneously targeting expressive and physiological responses) and acceptance influence emotion coherence. Results again showed that suppression decreased coherence. By contrast, acceptance was not significantly different from the unregulated condition. These findings help to clarify the nature of emotion response coherence by showing how different forms of emotion regulation may differentially affect it.","[Dan-Glauser, Elise S.; Gross, James J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Dan-Glauser, ES (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford Psychophysiol Lab, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",elise.danglauser@gmail.com,"Dan-Glauser, Elise/A-6776-2009","Dan-Glauser, Elise/0000-0002-1715-4650",NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH066957],,,50,22,25,2,40,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1528-3542,1931-1516,,EMOTION,Emotion,OCT,2013,13,5,,,,,832,842,,10.1037/a0032672,,,,11,"Psychology, Experimental",Psychology,232CQ,WOS:000325467200005,23731438,Green Accepted,,,4/26/19

A series of six experiments demonstrates that certain consumer behaviors, such as leaning back in a chair while shopping online, can activate the concept of balance and thereby affect the consumer decision-making process. Specifically, consumers experiencing a heightened sense of balance are more likely to choose compromise options. The authors propose and show evidence for the mechanism underlying these effects: that the concept of balance is metaphorically linked in the mind to the concept of parity and that activating balance increases the accessibility of the parity concept. The increased accessibility of parity changes consumer perceptions of the product offerings in a choice set, increasing the selection of compromise options because they provide parity on the described product attributes.","[Larson, Jeffrey S.; Billeter, Darron M.] Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch Management, Provo, UT 84602 USA","Larson, JS (reprint author), Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch Management, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",jeff_larson@byu.edu; darron@byu.edu,,,,,,29,9,9,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0022-2437,1547-7193,,J MARKETING RES,J.

We employed a priming paradigm, in which visual or auditory prime words (i.e., temporal adverbs such as yesterday, tomorrow) preceded a colored square. In all experiments, participants discriminated the color of this square by responding with the left or the right hand. Although the temporal reference of the priming adverb was task irrelevant in Experiment 1, visually presented primes facilitated responses to the square in correspondence with the direction of the mental time-line. This priming effect was absent in Experiments 2, 3, and 5, in which the primes were presented auditorily and the temporal reference of the words could be ignored. The effect, however, emerged when attention was oriented to the temporal content of the auditory prime words in Experiment 4.

However, little is known about how this cultural value might influence emotional processing. Here, we hypothesized that Asians are 'culturally trained' to down-regulate emotional processing when required to suppress emotional expressions. Such down-regulation, however, is unlikely for European Americans because their culture values emotional expression (vs control) more. To test these predictions, we adopted the parietal late positive potential (LPP) of the event-related potential as an objective indicator of emotional processing. Both Asian and European Americans were exposed to either unpleasant or neutral pictures while instructed to either attend or suppress expression of emotions. Both groups showed an equally pronounced parietal positivity similar to 600 ms post-stimulus. As predicted, however, Asians subsequently showed a significant decrease of the parietal LPP in the suppression (vs attend) condition. The initial positivity completely disappeared 2000 ms post-stimulus. In contrast, for European Americans the parietal LPP suppression effect was completely absent although there was an early occurring, sustained increase in frontal positivity in the suppression (vs attend) condition.

For example, reading sentences with positive meanings (""The water park is refreshing on the hot summer day"") induces patterns of facial feedback congruent with the sentence emotionality (smiling), whereas sentences with negative meanings induce a frown. Moreover, blocking facial afference with botox selectively slows comprehension of emotional sentences. Therefore, theories of cognition should account for emotion-language interactions above the level of explicit emotion words, and the role of peripheral feedback in comprehension. For this special issue exploring frontiers in the role of the body and environment in cognition, we propose a theory in which facial feedback provides a context-sensitive constraint on the simulation of actions described in language. Paralleling the role of emotions in real-world behavior, our account proposes that (1) facial expressions accompany sudden shifts in wellbeing as described in language; (2) facial expressions modulate emotional action systems during reading; and (3) emotional action systems prepare the reader for an effective simulation of the ensuing language content. To inform the theory and guide future research, we outline a framework based on internal models for motor control. To support the theory, we assemble evidence from diverse areas of research. Taking a functional view of emotion, we tie the theory to behavioral and neural evidence for a role of facial feedback in cognition. Our theoretical framework provides a detailed account that can guide future research on the role of emotional feedback in language processing, and on interactions of language and emotion. It also highlights the bodily periphery as relevant to theories of embodied cognition.","[Havas, David A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA; [Matheson, James] Hampshire Coll, Sch Cognit Sci, Amherst, MA 01002 USA","Havas, DA (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 800 W Main St, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA.",havasd@uww.edu,,,,,,143,12,13,1,21,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Cognition is for adaptive action, involves the body and sensori-motor systems, is situated in immediate intercourse with the environment, and is distributed across other minds and tools. Here, we introduce two broader themes: social cognition is special because other people's movements and other characteristics can be mapped onto our own bodies; and social cognition is emergent, influencing the parts and subsystems that generate it rather than the reverse causal direction. We then review the current state of theory and research in the four topic areas that we laid out in 2004. We conclude by noting that much research on these themes has occurred outside of social psychology, and stressing the benefits for the future of an integrative, inter-disciplinary approach to these core issues of social psychology.","[Semin, Gun R.] Univ Utrecht, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Semin, Gun R.] Koc Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Smith, Eliot R.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Semin, GR (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Heidelberglaan 1, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",G.R.Semin@uu.nl,"sebastianovitsch, stepan/G-8507-2013; Semin, Gun/J-4046-2013","Semin, Gun/0000-0002-5304-5566",,,,148,30,31,3,58,GUILFORD PUBLICATIONS INC,NEW YORK,"370 SEVENTH AVE, SUITE 1200, NEW YORK, NY 10001-1020 USA",0278-016X,,,SOC COGNITION,Soc.

We reason, on the basis of prior research, that prior to a physical confrontation, smiles are a nonverbal sign of reduced hostility and aggression, and thereby unintentionally communicate reduced physical dominance. Two studies provide evidence in support of this prediction: Study 1 found that professional fighters who smiled more in a prefight photograph taken facing their opponent performed more poorly during the fight in relation to their less intensely smiling counterparts. In Study 2, untrained observers judged a fighter as less hostile and aggressive, and thereby less physically dominant when the fighters' facial expression was manipulated to show a smiling expression in relation to the same fighter displaying a neutral expression. Discussion focused on the reasons why smiles are associated with decreased physical dominance.","[Kraus, Michael W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chen, Teh-Way David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Kraus, MW (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, 603 E Daniel St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",mwkraus@illinois.edu,,,,,,43,19,21,7,70,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1528-3542,1931-1516,,EMOTION,Emotion,APR,2013,13,2,,,,,270,279,,10.1037/a0030745,,,,10,"Psychology, Experimental",Psychology,125FI,WOS:000317524600011,23356564,,,,4/26/19

Twenty-four participants with TBI and 28 control participants adopted facial expressions and body postures according to specific instructions and maintained these positions for 10s. Expressions and postures entailed anger, sadness, and happiness as well as a neutral (baseline) condition. After each expression/posture manipulation, participants evaluated their subjective emotional state (including cheerfulness, sadness, and irritation). TBI participants were globally less responsive to the effects of body and facial feedback than control participants, F(1,50) = 55.89, p = .02, eta(2) = .11. More interestingly, the TBI group differed from the Control group across emotions, F(8,400) = 2.51, p = .01, eta(2) = .05. Specifically, participants with TBI were responsive to happy but not to negative expression/posture manipulations whereas control participants were responsive to happy, angry, and sad expression/posture manipulations. In conclusion, TBI appears to impair the ability to recognize both the physical configuration of a negative emotion and its associated subjective feeling.

Experiment 1 investigated the effect of negative facial feedback (frowning) on a basic threat-interpretation bias procedure using a homophone spelling task and found that participants in a frowning condition interpreted significantly more threat/neutral homophones as threats than did participants in a neutral control condition. Experiment 2 investigated how frowning affected interpretation of bodily sensations. The findings indicated that participants in the frowning condition generated fewer positive consequences for bodily sensation scenarios and also rated the imagined bodily sensations as more negative and more of a cause for health concern. These effects could not simply be explained by differences in self-reported mood or by demand characteristics. These findings suggest that facial expressions have a moderating effect on the cognitive processes that contribute to clinically-relevant ambiguity resolution, and this has implications for clinical interventions.","[Davey, Graham C.

However, people regularly encounter objects or situations about which they simultaneously hold both positive and negative views, which results in the experience of ambivalence. Such experiences are often described in physical terms: For example, people say they are ""wavering"" between two sides of an issue or are ""torn."" Building on this observation, we designed two studies to explore the relationship between the experience of ambivalence and side-to-side movement, or wavering. In Study 1, we used a Wii Balance Board to measure movement and found that people who are experiencing ambivalence move from side to side more than people who are not experiencing ambivalence. In Study 2, we induced body movement to explore the reverse relationship and found that when people are made to move from side to side, their experiences of ambivalence are enhanced.","[Schneider, Iris K.; van Harreveld, Frenk; Rotteveel, Mark; van der Pligt, Joop] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Eerland, Anita; Zwaan, Rolf A.] Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van der Stoep, Nathan] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","Schneider, IK (reprint author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, van der Boechorststr 1, NL-1081 BT Amsterdam, Netherlands.",i.k.schneider@vu.nl,"Van der Stoep, Nathan/M-1417-2017","Van der Stoep, Nathan/0000-0002-0412-2078",,,,34,22,22,3,230,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,1467-9280,,PSYCHOL SCI,Psychol.

Implementing consonant and dissonant chords (Experiments 1 and 5), naturalistic sounds (Experiment 2), and visual facial primes (Experiment 3) in an (in) direct semantic priming paradigm, as well as brief facial feedback in a summative priming paradigm (Experiment 4), yielded increased priming effects under brief positive compared to negative affect. Furthermore, this modulation took place on the level of semantic spreading rather than on strategic mechanisms (Experiment 5). Alternative explanations such as distraction, motivation, arousal, and cognitive tuning could be ruled out. This phasic affective modulation constitutes a mechanism overlooked thus far that may contaminate priming effects in all priming paradigms that involve affective stimuli. Furthermore, this mechanism provides a novel explanation for the observation that priming effects are usually larger for positive than for negative stimuli. Finally, it has important implications for linguistic research, by suggesting that association norms may be biased for affective words.","[Topolinski, Sascha] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Deutsch, Roland] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Psychol, D-01062 Dresden, Germany","Topolinski, S (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol 2, Roentgenring 10, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",sascha.topolinski@psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Str 264/25-1],"This research was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Str 264/25-1).

We propose that both leader happiness and leader sadness can be beneficial for follower performance contingent on whether the task concerns creative or analytical performance. This proposition was put to the test in two experiments in which leader affective display was manipulated and the performance of (student) participants was assessed. The results supported our hypothesis that a leader's displays of happiness enhance follower creative performance, whereas a leader's displays of sadness enhance follower analytical performance. Contrasting these findings with evidence for a subjective rating of leadership effectiveness, in line with an implicit leadership theory interpretation, leaders were perceived as more effective when displaying happiness rather than sadness irrespective of task type. The second study showed that the effects of leader affective displays on followers' creative performance and perceived leadership effectiveness are mediated by follower positive affect, indicating that emotional contagion partly underlies these effects.

Participants were first exposed to a story that elicited mostly positive thoughts (about an employee's good day at work) or negative thoughts (about an employee's bad day at work). After writing down their thoughts, participants were asked to hold a pen with their teeth (smile) or with their lips (control). Finally, all participants reported the extent to which they liked the story. In line with the self-validation hypothesis, we predicted and found that the effect of the initial thought direction induction on story evaluations was greater for smiling than control participants. These results conceptually replicate those obtained in previous research on embodiment (i.e., more favorable evaluations of stories when smiling; Strack, Martin, & Stepper, 1988) when participants had positive thoughts, but showed the opposite pattern of results (less favorable evaluations for smiling) for negative thoughts.","[Paredes, Borja; Brinol, Pablo] Univ Autonoma Madrid, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Stavraki, Maria; Brinol, Pablo] Univ A Distancia Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Petty, Richard E.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Brinol, P (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Psychol, Campus Cantoblanco Crta Colmenar,Km 15, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",pablo.brinnol@uam.es,"Brinol, Pablo/B-7329-2011; Paredes, Borja/H-2485-2015; Stavraki, Maria/C-6112-2011; Petty, Richard/A-5977-2008","Brinol, Pablo/0000-0002-0327-5865; Paredes, Borja/0000-0002-2418-3337; Stavraki, Maria/0000-0003-3924-4419; Petty, Richard/0000-0002-2870-8575",,,,31,8,9,0,22,HOGREFE & HUBER PUBLISHERS,GOTTINGEN,"MERKELSTR 3, D-37085 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY",1864-9335,2151-2590,,SOC PSYCHOL-GERMANY,Soc.

Jointly, these terms imply that the brain, physical attributes of the self, and features of our interpersonal relationships and of the environments in which we live jointly regulate energy and information flow; they codetermine how we think, feel, and behave both individually and collectively. In addition to direct experience, evidence supports the view that stimuli embedded within past memories trigger multimodal simulations throughout the body and brain to literally recreate lived experience. In this paper, we review empirical support for the concept of an embodied and relational mind and then reflect on the implications of this perspective for clinical interventions in aging individuals and populations. Data suggest that environmental influences literally ""get under the skin"" with aging; that musculoskeletal and visceral sensations become more prominent in activities of the mind due to aging biological systems and chronic disease. We argue that conceiving the mind as embodied and relational will grow scientific inquiry in aging, transform how we think about the self-system and well-being, and lead us to rethink health promotion interventions aimed at aging individuals and populations.","[Rejeski, W.

We propose that coordination in the successful pursuit of a goal increases positive affect which in turn strengthens those social ties for maintaining relationships that are characteristic of effective coordination. In two experiments, participants performed a virtual task on a computer in tandem with a virtual co-actor, whose behavior was generated by a computer program. In Experiment 1, successful performance on a complex task required behavior coordination. In Experiment 2, behavioral coordination was manipulated independently of successful performance. Results showed that behavioral coordination promotes liking (Experiment 1) and that this effect is manifest under success but not failure (Experiment 2). Discussion centers on the adaptive value of behavioral and emotional coordination, the link between coordination and other psychological processes, and the conditions that promote rather than hinder the attainment of such interaction fluency.","[Kulesza, Wojciech] Warsaw Sch Social Sci & Humanities, PL-03815 Warsaw, Poland; [Vallacher, Robin R.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Psychol, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Nowak, Andrzej] Univ Warsaw, Dept Psychol, PL-00183 Warsaw, Poland","Kulesza, W (reprint author), Warsaw Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Chodakowska 19-31, PL-03815 Warsaw, Poland.",wkulesza@swps.edu.pl; vallacher@fau.edu; andrzejn232@gmail.com,,"Kulesza, Wojciech/0000-0001-5457-6396",,,,61,3,3,1,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1860-0832,,978-3-642-31435-3,UNDERST COMPLEX SYST,,,2013,,,,,,,171,190,,10.1007/978-3-642-31436-0_10,10.1007/978-3-642-31436-0,,,20,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Psychology; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BEV76,WOS:000318317700011,,,,,4/26/19

The present review describes the current knowledge of the neurobiological and psychological fundamentals on the relation of facial movement and its emotional context. So far there is not much knowledge on the impact of a facial palsy on the interaction between facial movement, emotional processing and communicative skills of the patient. The emotional contagion seems to be reduced in patients with facial palsy. The ability to express emotions seems also to be reduced. Moreover, the patients feel to be perceived negatively. In fact, most of the expressions of patients with facial palsy are allocated with a negative affect even when the patients are smiling. Patients with facial palsy react with negative stress, anxiety and depression. The patients avoid social contacts. In turn, this reinforces the communicative disorder. The otorhinolaryngologist can use the Facial Disability Index as a simple questionnaire to detect such dysfunctions. Diagnostics that are necessary to develop a therapy program are presented in this review. Standardized therapy concepts that are not only treat the movement disorder but also the emotional context is missing so far. Finally, the review will give an outlook on potential therapy strategies.","[Dobel, C.] Univ Munster, Inst Biomagnetismus & Biosignalanal, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Miltner, W. H.

The current study was designed to extend these findings in several ways. First, it assesses the role of other bodily responses (leg position and leg movements) in formation of attitudes. Second, it investigates whether the ""body-attitude compatibility effect"" occurs only when individuals evaluate ideas in the message (e.g.,Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 1990) and process the language about themselves (Stepper & Strack, 1993), or whether it also occurs for evaluation of the protagonist. Finally, it examines whether engaging in real body movement influences attitudes to the same extent as merely preparing the body for movement. Method: A total of 38 individuals (M-age = 23.03, SDage = 5.53) participated in the first experiment (10 male, 26 female, 2 did not indicate gender). Participants were randomly assigned into one of the two conditions and their bodily positions and movements were manipulated. Participants in the control condition read the text while standing erect in front of the computer screen with the two feet together. Participants in the advanced facilitation condition first exercised on a stationary bike for a minute. Then, they read the text from the computer that was on the height-adjustable rostrum while standing erect in front of the computer screen with their lead leg advanced forward (40 centimeters from the follow leg). Finally, when participants finished reading the target text, they were asked to fill in the questionnaire regarding protagonist's competence and activeness skills. Participants in both conditions (control and advanced facilitation) filled in the questionnaire standing with the two feet together. A total of 37 individuals (M-age = 22.84, SDage = 5.61) participated in the second experiment (13 male, 22 female, 2 did not indicate gender). The procedure was identical to that for Experiment 1, with the exception that participants in the basic facilitation condition did not exercise on the bike prior to reading the text. Results and Conclusion: Results showed that participants in the basic facilitation and advanced facilitation conditions scored protagonist's competence and activeness skills significantly higher than participants in the control condition. These results lend support to a theory of social embodiment which suggests that reenactments of perceptual, motor, and introspective states represent knowledge (Barsalou, Niedenthal, Barbey, & Ruppert, 2003).","[Giger, Jean-Christophe; Horchak, Oleksandr V.] Univ Algarve, Dept Psychol & Educ Sci, Faro, Portugal; [Pochwatko, Grzegorz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, PL-00901 Warsaw, Poland","Giger, JC (reprint author), Univ Algarve, Dept Psychol & Educ Sci, Faro, Portugal.",,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,WORLD INST ADVANCED RESEARCH & SCIENCE,LISBON,"RUA TOMAS RIBEIRO, 45, 1 DTO, LISBON, 1050-225, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-97866-0-8,,,,2013,,,,,,,157,158,,,,,,2,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Psychology,BC6ZB,WOS:000354623100040,,,,,4/26/19

The present study extends this research in two ways. First, whereas most previous studies used sentence stimuli, our research focused on extended linguistic events (texts). Second, both online (self-paced reading times) and offline (verbatim and inference questions) measures of comprehension were taken. Method: 60 individuals ranging in age from 18 to 58 (M-age = 26.72, SDage = 8.50) were recruited to take part in the experiment: 26 participants were male M-age = 29.42: SDage = 10.93), 32 were female (M-age = 24.63; SDage = 5.36), and two participants did not indicate gender. First, participants were instructed to read a neutral non-emotional text which served as a baseline for later measurements. Second, facial posture was manipulated: participants were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions and asked to read a target text identical in size to the tutorial text (divided into 8 paragraphs). In the matching condition participants read the text while holding the pen sideways between the teeth to force a partial smile (Oberman, Winkielman, & Ramachandran, 2007), in the mismatching condition participants read the target text while having a pen straight between the lips, without touching the pen with their teeth, to prevent smile (Oberman et al., 2007; Strack, Martin, & Stepper, 1988), and in the control (neutral) condition participants read the target text in a normal condition without a pen. Reading times for both tutorial and target texts were collected. Third, participants answered a set of filler questions. Fourth, participants' offline explicit and implicit comprehension of discourse was assessed. Design: An 8 (Paragraphs 1 to 8) within factor x 3 (condition: matching vs. mismatching vs. control) between factor mixed ANOVA, with tutorial reading time as a covariate, was conducted to analyze the reading times of the target text. Offline performance was assessed as the between-participants variable. Results: Reading times were faster when participants' facial postures were congruent with emotional valence of the text (matching condition) rather than incongruent (mismatching condition) or neutral (control condition). At the same time, manipulation with facial posture had no influence on offline measures of comprehension. This suggests that emotion simulation is involved in online comprehension, but may not have any consequences for offline discourse processing.","[Horchak, Oleksandr V.; Giger, Jean-Christophe] Univ Algarve, Dept Psychol & Educ Sci, Faro, Portugal; [Pochwatko, Grzegorz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, PL-00901 Warsaw, Poland","Horchak, OV (reprint author), Univ Algarve, Dept Psychol & Educ Sci, Faro, Portugal.",,,,,,,5,0,0,1,3,WORLD INST ADVANCED RESEARCH & SCIENCE,LISBON,"RUA TOMAS RIBEIRO, 45, 1 DTO, LISBON, 1050-225, PORTUGAL",,,978-989-97866-0-8,,,,2013,,,,,,,266,266,,,,,,1,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",Psychology,BC6ZB,WOS:000354623100065,,,,,4/26/19

In Experiment 2, we verified whether emotion recognition is hampered by stimuli in which an upper or lower half-face showing an emotional expression is combined with a neutral half-face. We found that the neutral lower half-face interfered with recognition of happiness and disgust, whereas the neutral upper half impaired recognition of anger; recognition of fear and sadness was impaired by both manipulations, whereas recognition of surprise was not affected by either manipulation.

Awareness was manipulated by explicitly asking half of all participants in the smiling groups to smile (and giving the other half no instructions related to smiling). Findings revealed that all smiling participants, regardless of whether they were aware of smiling, had lower heart rates during stress recovery than the neutral group did, with a slight advantage for those with Duchenne smiles. Participants in the smiling groups who were not explicitly asked to smile reported less of a decrease in positive affect during a stressful task than did the neutral group.

This tendency is known as linguistic expectancy bias. Two experiments examined the influence of approach and avoidance motivational orientations on the production of this linguistic expectancy bias. It was predicted that approach strategic orientation is likely to describe expectancy consistent behaviors at a higher level of linguistic abstraction than expectancy inconsistent behaviors. In contrast, avoidance strategic orientation is likely to describe both expectancy consistent behaviors and expectancy inconsistent behaviors at a lower level of linguistic abstraction, thus facilitating the disappearance of linguistic expectancy bias.

Although research in this area is burgeoning, much of it has been more descriptive than explanatory. We provide a critical discussion of the trajectory of embodiment research in social psychology. We contend that future researchers should engage in a phenomenon-based approach, highlight the theoretical boundary conditions and mediators involved, explore novel action-relevant outcome measures, and address the role of individual differences broadly defined. Such research will likely provide a more explanatory account of the role of embodiment in general terms as well as how it expands the knowledge base in social psychology.","[Meier, Brian P.] Gettysburg Coll, Dept Psychol, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA; [Schnall, Simone] Univ Cambridge, Dept Social & Dev Psychol, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Schwarz, Norbert] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bargh, John A.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Meier, BP (reprint author), Gettysburg Coll, Dept Psychol, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA.",bmeier@gettysburg.edu,"Schwarz, Norbert/B-3591-2008","Schwarz, Norbert/0000-0002-8868-7067",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I031758/1],,,67,121,125,1,103,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1756-8757,1756-8765,,TOP COGN SCI,Top.

We claim that sometimes music can appropriately be heard as containing a ""persona,"" a fictional or virtual agent whose emotions are expressed in the music, and that this persona can be experienced as expressing more complex emotions, such as hopefulness or resignation, as well as blends of emotion, and emotions that develop and change over time. A complex piece of music may have a composed expressive trajectory or musical ""plot,"" which dramatizes a psychological journey by a persona. Moreover, listeners may be invited not only to recognize the emotions expressed in such music but also to experience those emotions themselves, either actually or in imagination, by empathizing with the musical persona as he or she travels on a psychological journey through the music. Such experiences are typically reinforced by the arousal of actual physiological states and action tendencies in listeners. We illustrate our argument by means of analyses of the Prelude in El, Minor from Book I of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier and the third movement of Brahms's Piano Quartet in C Minor, Opus 60. Finally, we admit that not all listeners will approach music in the way we suggest, but we argue that listening in the way we recommend can significantly enrich our musical experiences.","[Robinson, Jenefer] Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Hatten, Robert S.] Univ Texas Austin, Butler Sch Mus, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Robinson, J (reprint author), Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",,,,,,,77,14,14,0,17,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,BERKELEY,"C/O JOURNALS & DIGITAL PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2000 CENTER ST, STE 303, BERKELEY, CA 94704-1223 USA",0195-6167,,,MUSIC THEOR SPECTRUM,Music Theory Spectr.,FAL,2012,34,2,,,,,71,106,,10.1525/mts.2012.34.2.71,,,,36,Music,Music,070UQ,WOS:000313538500004,,,,,4/26/19

According to the motivational priming theory, pain should facilitate the processing of unpleasant and hamper the processing of pleasant affective stimuli. To this end, we investigated the influence of tonic pain on the processing of happy and angry faces in 30 healthy participants. As a measure of affect processing, the interference of picture content on participants' voluntary reactions to the pictures either with a compatible or an incompatible facial muscle (M. zygomaticus major [""smile""] or M. corrugator supercilii [""frown""]) was recorded by electromyogram (EMG). Additionally, participants rated valence and arousal of each picture. During both tasks, the participants received either painful or non-painful pressure stimulation. Pain stimulation was generally associated with slower compatible and incompatible muscle responses (M. zygomaticus and M. corrugator) and fewer erroneous incompatible (M. corrugator) responses to happy faces. However, pain did not affect muscle responses to angry faces and explicit valence and arousal ratings. Thus, pain seems to selectively influence the responses to happy faces, which may result from a slowed processing of incongruent information (happy/pain). That happy faces are processed differently during pain may bear important implications for social interactions during acute and possibly even chronic pain states.

We offer a potentially unifying framework to integrate past findings and capture the diverse impact that clothes can have on the wearer by proposing that enclothed cognition involves the co-occurrence of two independent factors- the symbolic meaning of the clothes and the physical experience of wearing them. As a first test of our enclothed cognition perspective, the current research explored the effects of wearing a lab coat. A pretest found that a lab coat is generally associated with attentiveness and carefulness. We therefore predicted that wearing a lab coat would increase performance on attention-related tasks. In Experiment 1, physically wearing a lab coat increased selective attention compared to not wearing a lab coat. In Experiments 2 and 3. wearing a lab coat described as a doctor's coat increased sustained attention compared to wearing a lab coat described as a painter's coat, and compared to simply seeing or even identifying with a lab coat described as a doctor's coat. Thus, the current research suggests a basic principle of enclothed cognition-it depends on both the symbolic meaning and the physical experience of wearing the clothes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

From a managerial perspective, sensory marketing can be used to create subconscious triggers that characterize consumer perceptions of abstract notions of the product (e.g., its sophistication or quality). Given the gamut of explicit marketing appeals made to consumers every day, subconscious triggers which appeal to the basic senses may be a more efficient way to engage consumers. Also, these sensory triggers may result in consumers' self-generation of (desirable) brand attributes, rather than those verbally provided by the advertiser. The understanding of these sensory triggers implies an understanding of sensation and perception as it applies to consumer behavior-this is the research perspective of sensory marketing. This review article presents an overview of research on sensory perception. The review also points out areas where little research has been done, so that each additional paper has a greater chance of making a bigger difference and sparking further research. It is quite apparent from the review that there still remains tremendous need for research within the domain of sensory marketing-research that can be very impactful.

Whether there is also variation in early-stage affective (i.e. valenced) responses resulting from such images, however, is not yet known. The present study used the subliminal affective priming paradigm to investigate whether people varying in trait social anxiety also differ in their affective responses to very briefly presented, emotionally expressive face images. Methodology/Principal Findings: Participants (n = 67) completed a subliminal affective priming task, in which briefly presented and smiling, neutral and angry faces were shown for 10 ms durations (below objective and subjective thresholds for visual discrimination), and immediately followed by a randomly selected Chinese character mask (2000 ms). Ratings of participants' liking for each Chinese character indicated the degree of valenced affective response made to the unseen emotive images. Participants' ratings of their liking for the Chinese characters were significantly influenced by the type of face image preceding them, with smiling faces generating more positive ratings than neutral and angry ones (F(2,128) = 3.107, p<0.05). Self-reported social anxiety was positively correlated with ratings of smiling relative to neutral-face primed characters (Pearson's r =.323, p<0.01). Individual variation in self-reported mood awareness was not associated with ratings. Conclusions: Trait social anxiety is associated with individual variation in affective responding, even in response to the earliest, pre-attentive stage of visual image processing. However, the fact that these priming effects are limited to smiling and not angry (i.e. threatening) images leads us to propose that the pre-attentive processes involved in generating the subliminal affective priming effect may be different from those that generate attentional biases in anxious individuals.","[Paul, Elizabeth S.; Pope, Stuart A.

Theories of embodied emotion, however, suggest that such reactions might also occur across expressive channels, because simulation is based on integrated motoric and affective representations of that emotion. In the present studies, we examined this idea by focusing on facial and experiential reactions to nonverbal emotion vocalizations. In Studies 1 and 2, we showed that both hearing and reproducing vocalizations of anger, disgust, happiness, and sadness resulted in specific facial behaviors, as well as congruent self-reported emotions (Study 2). In Studies 3 and 4, we showed that the inhibition of congruent facial actions impaired listeners' processing of emotion vocalizations (Study 3), as well as their experiences of a concordant subjective state (Study 4). Results support the idea that cross-channel simulations of others' states serve facilitative functions similar to more strict imitations of observed expressive behavior, suggesting flexibility in the motoric and affective systems involved in emotion processing and interpersonal emotion transfer.

However, the underlying mechanisms have not been formally tested. This article examines the role of semantic activations underlying such influences, focusing on the effects of a ubiquitous physical experience-""carrying weight""-on consumers' judgment of importance. Five experiments provide converging evidence that semantic activation is the primary underlying process for the effect. Specifically, physically carrying a load is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for processing the concept of importance. The effect is fully mediated by semantic activation of related weight concepts. Moreover, processing the concept of importance does not necessarily influence the physical experience of carrying weight. An affective state such as mental stress (psychological load), however, does have a reciprocal effect on the physical experience of carrying weight, indicating that there might be different pathways between weight experience and its metaphorically linked concepts.","[Zhang, Meng] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business Adm, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiuping] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Singapore 119245, Singapore","Zhang, M (reprint author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business Adm, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",zhangmeng@baf.msmail.cuhk.edu.hk; bizlx@nus.edu.sg,"LI, XP/B-3662-2016",,,,,42,34,37,3,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0093-5301,1537-5277,,J CONSUM RES,J.

Evidence for these perceptual simulations comes from neuroimaging and behavioural research, such as demonstrations of somatotopic motor cortex activations following the presentation of action-related words, or facilitation of grasp responses following presentation of object names. However, the interpretation of such effects has been called into question by suggestions that neural activation in modality-specific sensorimotor regions may be epiphenomenal, and merely the result of spreading activations from ""disembodied"", abstracted, symbolic representations. Here, we present two studies that focus on the perceptual modalities of touch and proprioception. We show that in a timed object-comparison task, concurrent tactile or proprioceptive stimulation to the hands facilitates conceptual processing relative to control stimulation. This facilitation occurs only for small, manipulable objects, where tactile and proprioceptive information form part of the multimodal perceptual experience of interacting with such objects, but facilitation is not observed for large, nonmanipulable objects where such perceptual information is uninformative. Importantly, these facilitation effects are independent of motor and action planning, and indicate that modality-specific perceptual information plays a functionally constitutive role in our mental representations of objects, which supports embodied assumptions that concepts are grounded in the same neural systems that govern perception and action.","[Connell, Louise] Univ Manchester, Sch Psychol Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Lynott, Dermot] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Decis & Cognit Sci Res Ctr, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Dreyer, Felix] Univ Leipzig, Dept Psychol, Leipzig, Germany","Connell, L (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Sch Psychol Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.",louise.connell@manchester.ac.uk; dermot.lynott@manchester.ac.uk,"Connell, Louise/D-1793-2014; Lynott, Dermot/A-9661-2011","Connell, Louise/0000-0002-5291-5267; Lynott, Dermot/0000-0001-7338-0567",British Academy,"The studies reported here were supported by a grant from the British Academy to LC and DL.

Intuitions about the consequences of learning procedures can easily be misleading, making these principles particularly important. To illustrate this point, we identified recent examples of studies applying a particular learning paradigm-response-reversal training-to the study of three different psychological problems (e.g., why objects in the right side of space are preferred to those in the left in right-handed people). The strategy of each study was to alter a typically encountered contingency once in the laboratory, in order to reverse a hypothesized learned response. Yet, contrary to intuitions, we demonstrate that behavior changes can be observed without the reversal of a prior association. Further, many different associative changes can underlie response reversals. We focus on these examples of response-reversal training, but our broader aim is to help connect the animal learning literature to problems in cognitive and social psychology in an effort to strengthen the inferences that might be drawn about learned associations in these contexts.","[Coutanche, Marc N.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, Solomon Labs, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Coutanche, MN (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, Solomon Labs, 3720 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",coumarc@psych.upenn.edu,"Thompson-Schill, Sharon/M-1788-2013","Coutanche, Marc/0000-0002-2232-3519",,,,95,5,5,0,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1745-6916,,,PERSPECT PSYCHOL SCI,Perspect.

In Studies 2 and 3, adults (N = 514) indicated their current position in their life span, and rated their MIL. PA, whether naturally occurring (Study 2) or induced (Study 3), was a stronger predictor of MIL for individuals who perceived themselves as having a limited amount of time left to live. Finally, in Study 4 (N = 98) students completed a measure of PA, MIL, and future time perspective (FTP). Results showed that PA was more strongly linked to MIL for those who believed they had fewer opportunities left to pursue their goals. Overall, these findings suggest that the experience of PA becomes increasingly associated with the experience of MIL as the perception of future time becomes limited.

The striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, like the mesolimbic dopamine system that modulates their function, are thought to be involved in emotional processing. As Parkinson's disease is histopathologically characterized by the selective, progressive, and chronic degeneration of the nigrostriatal and mesocorticolimbic dopamine systems, it can therefore serve as a model for assessing the functional role of these circuits in humans. In the present review, we begin by providing a synopsis of the emotional disturbances observed in Parkinson's disease.

Some emotions, notably disgust, are more closely coupled to visceral state than others. Cardiac baroreceptors, activated at systole within each cardiac cycle, provide short-term visceral feedback. Here we explored how phasic baroreceptor activation may alter the appraisal of brief emotional stimuli and consequent cardiovascular reactions. We used functional MRI (fMRI) to measure brain responses to emotional face stimuli presented before and during cardiac systole. We observed that the processing of emotional stimuli was altered by concurrent natural baroreceptor activation. Specifically, facial expressions of disgust were judged as more intense when presented at systole, and rebound heart rate increases were attenuated after expressions of disgust and happiness. Neural activity within prefrontal cortex correlated with emotionality ratings. Activity within periaqueductal gray matter reflected both emotional ratings and their interaction with cardiac timing. Activity within regions including prefrontal and visual cortices correlated with increases in heart rate evoked by the face stimuli, while orbitofrontal activity reflected both evoked heart rate change and its interaction with cardiac timing. Our findings demonstrate that momentary physiological fluctuations in cardiovascular afferent information (1) influence specific emotional judgments, mediated through regions including the periaqueductal gray matter, and (2) shape evoked autonomic responses through engagement of orbitofrontal cortex. Together these findings highlight the close coupling of visceral and emotional processes and identify neural regions mediating bodily state influences on affective judgment.","[Gray, Marcus A.; Minati, Ludovico; Nagai, Yoko; Harrison, Neil A.; Critchley, Hugo D.] Univ Sussex, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch BSMS, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Gray, Marcus A.] Univ Sussex, Ctr Consciousness Sci, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Beacher, Felix D.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Stony Brook, NY USA; [Minati, Ludovico] Fdn IRCCS Ist Neurol Carlo Besta, Milan, Italy; [Nagai, Yoko] Univ Essex, Dept Psychol, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Kemp, Andrew H.] Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Harrison, Neil A.; Critchley, Hugo D.] Sussex Partnership NHS Fdn Trust, Sussex Educ Ctr, Millview Hosp, Hove, England; [Critchley, Hugo D.] Univ Sussex, Sackler Ctr Consciousness Sci, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England","Gray, MA (reprint author), Monash Univ, Sch Psychol & Psychiat, Fac Med Nursing & Hlth Sci, Expt Neuropsychol Res Unit, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",Marcus.Gray@Monash.edu,"Gray, Marcus/F-6521-2013; Minati, Ludovico/R-1076-2017; Kemp, Andrew/C-7984-2012","Gray, Marcus/0000-0001-8671-6939; Minati, Ludovico/0000-0002-2532-1674; Kemp, Andrew/0000-0003-1146-3791; critchley, hugo/0000-0002-2445-9284; beacher, felix/0000-0002-4130-4073; Harrison, Neil/0000-0002-9584-3769",Wellcome Trust,,,80,67,67,0,32,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1528-3542,1931-1516,,EMOTION,Emotion,FEB,2012,12,1,,,,,180,191,,10.1037/a0025083,,,,12,"Psychology, Experimental",Psychology,888BZ,WOS:000299980100023,21988743,,,,4/26/19

The authors propose BII can also be a psychological state and modulated by shifts in processing styles. In four experiments, the authors induced a global or local processing style using physical posture (Experiment 1) and cognitive manipulations (Experiments 2-4) and found that BII is enhanced in contexts facilitating a more global processing style (i.e., smiling, high-level construal, and similarity focus). The authors also found that contrastive responses to cultural cues are diminished when BII is situationally enhanced.

This study addresses this limitation by introducing and validating two novel implicit measures of blood donation attitudes. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Healthy young adults (n = 253) performed both image and word versions of a Single Target Implicit Association Test (STIAT) and then completed self-report measures of blood donation attitudes, blood and needle fears, social desirability, and donation intention. RESULTS: These results affirmed the validity of the blood donation ST-IATs in at least three ways. First, as expected, nondonors demonstrated more negative implicit donation attitudes than donors. Second, the implicit measures were significantly related in expected directions with explicit measures of donation attitudes as well as blood and needle fears. Finally, implicit donation attitudes were significantly related to donation intention, and the Image ST-IAT (but not the Word ST-IAT) significantly enhanced prediction of donation intention over and above needle fears and marginally enhanced prediction over and above blood fears. CONCLUSION: Image and word versions of the blood donation ST-IAT offer a valid method of assessing underlying automatic attitudes toward blood donation.","[Warfel, Regina M.; France, Christopher R.; France, Janis L.] Ohio Univ, Dept Psychol, Athens, OH 45701 USA","France, CR (reprint author), Ohio Univ, Dept Psychol, 251 Porter Hall, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",france@ohio.edu,,,,,,47,4,4,2,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0041-1132,,,TRANSFUSION,Transfusion,FEB,2012,52,2,,,,,356,365,,10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03271.x,,,,10,Hematology,Hematology,875NO,WOS:000299038200021,21827501,,,,4/26/19

This chapter attempts to revisit the conclusions of the Hawthorne studies and revitalize interest in influences of physical work environments on diverse organizational outcomes. We do so by reviewing recent research in related disciplines suggesting that concrete physical constructs, such as light and darkness, are not only features of the physical environment, but also important psychological foundations for abstract understanding. We discuss how findings in metaphor and embodied cognition can illuminate our understanding of how, why, and when features of the physical work environment, such as illumination, temperature, and space may shape organizational behavior.

However, there is a paucity of published research regarding the effect of dance on consumption. In particular, studies on how black social dance in commercials depicts culturally defining racial tensions and stereotypes, and its effect on Euro American consumption are scant. Consequently, qualitative research was employed to survey and interview a small group of Euro American respondents. A Diet Pepsi commercial served as the research text. A consuming value system reinforced the association of the dance with consumption of individual identity as cool; fractured conformity away from the defining macro social structure; and provided for resistive self and community identities. Three contributions result from the research. First, an alternative way of seeking knowledge through dance theory demonstrated dance's value for consumer's lives. Second, Holt's 2004 work was built upon. The dance demonstrated cultural myth recreation in a ""macro dance"" performed in the ""micro dance"" of everyday life. Third, ethnographic dance premises were extended and served as the research framework.","Calif Lutheran Univ, Sch Management, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA","Walter, CS (reprint author), Calif Lutheran Univ, Sch Management, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA.",cjsmissouri@yahoo.com,,,,,,94,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1025-3866,1477-223X,,CONSUMP MARK CULT,Consump.

Reappraisal reduces emotional expression, the experience of both negative and positive feelings, and the amplitude of an event-related potential (ERP)-the late positive potential (LPP). In contrast, the strategy of expressive suppression (ES), being the inhibition of emotional expression, has been reported to reduce subjective feelings of positive, but not negative emotion, and has not yet been investigated with ERPs. We focused on the LPP to assess the correlates of ES in the context of humor perception. Twenty-two female participants rated sequences of humorous (H) and non-humorous (NH) pictures, while their zygomaticus muscle was recorded. A spontaneous (SP) condition, in which participants attended naturally to the pictures, resulted in higher ratings of funniness, increased smiling, and increased LPP amplitude for H compared to NH stimuli. An ES condition, in which participants suppressed their facial reactions, resulted in reduced smiling, without affecting subjective ratings. LPP amplitude did not differ between H and NH stimuli during ES, suggesting equal allocation of processing resources to both stimuli. These results suggest that, similarly to reappraisal, ES modifies the way the brain processes positive emotional stimuli.","[Korb, Sebastian; Grandjean, Didier; Delplanque, Sylvain; Scherer, Klaus R.] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Korb, Sebastian; Grandjean, Didier; Delplanque, Sylvain] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychol, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Samson, Andrea C.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Korb, S (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, 7 Rue Battoirs, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.",Sebastian.Korb@unige.ch,"Korb, Sebastian/A-6294-2016; Samson, Andrea/K-3928-2017","Korb, Sebastian/0000-0002-3517-3783; Samson, Andrea/0000-0001-6807-3132; Delplanque, Sylvain/0000-0002-9025-4754; Grandjean, Didier/0000-0001-6125-4520",Swiss Science Foundation,"All authors are supported by the Swiss Science Foundation.

The greatest attention is paid to the issue of microgravity, radiation and circadian rhythms, with emphasis on the adaptive changes in physiological and psycho-physiological processes. The study explores the issue of data acquisition and the quality of information processing under the condition of isolation and confinement from natural stimuli and indicators. In this way, the paper further deals with the signals available to crew members about the changes in their cognitive, affective and motivational processes. The paper claims that besides the physiological and psycho-physiological adaptation to the space environment, psychological adaptation necessarily goes on at the same time. It is concluded that the in-depth qualitative investigation of the psychological adaptation could provide a more complete understanding of the accommodation of cognitive, affective and motivational processes during spaceflights.","Psychol Ustav AV CR, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic","Polackova Solcova, I (reprint author), Psychol Ustav AV CR, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",polackova@praha.psu.cas.cz,"Polackova Solcova, Iva/H-6837-2014","Polackova Solcova, Iva/0000-0003-3130-5416",,,,51,1,1,1,15,ACADEMIA,PRAGUE 1,"PUBL HOUSE CZECH ACAD SCI VODICKOVA 40, PRAGUE 1 112 29, CZECH REPUBLIC",0009-062X,,,CESK PSYCHOL,Cesk.

The present study was designed to determine whether and how savoring influences daily happiness. Experience sampling methodology was used with 101 participants, who provided self-reports of their momentary positive events, savoring responses, and positive affect daily over a period of 30 days. Multilevel modeling analyses verified that (a) these three constructs were positively related to each other within a given day, (b) momentary savoring both mediated and moderated the impact of daily positive events on momentary happy mood, and (c) levels of trait savoring moderated the observed mediational pattern. These results provide support for the hypothesis that savoring is an important mechanism through which people derive happiness from positive events.","[Jose, Paul E.; Lim, Bee T.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Psychol, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Bryant, Fred B.] Loyola Univ, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60626 USA","Jose, PE (reprint author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Psychol, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",paul.jose@vuw.ac.nz,,"Jose, Paul/0000-0002-3104-1871",,,,49,53,55,5,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1743-9760,,,J POSIT PSYCHOL,J.

Although a variety of functions have been proposed and examined at different levels of abstraction, what is undeniable is that when emotional processing is compromised, most things social go awry. In this review we survey the research findings documenting the functions of emotion and link these to new discoveries about how emotion is accurately processed and transmitted. We focus specifically on emotion processing in dyads and groups, which reflects the current scientific trend. Within dyads, emotional expressions and learning and understanding through vicarious emotion are the phenomena of interest. Behavioral and brain mechanisms supporting their successful occurrence are evaluated. At the group level, group emotions and group-based emotions, two very different phenomena, are discussed, and mechanistic accounts are reviewed.","[Niedenthal, Paula M.] CNRS, Paris, France; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Niedenthal, PM (reprint author), CNRS, Paris, France.",niedenthal@wisc.edu,,,,,,247,120,121,6,148,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0066-4308,,978-0-8243-0263-4,ANNU REV PSYCHOL,Annu.

Evaluative priming does not yield differential responsiveness for congruent and incongruent trials when facial muscle activity is inhibited whereas the IAT-effect is shown to be impervious to such inhibition.

These metaphors aid communication, but theories of conceptual metaphor and embodiment led us to hypothesize that they can be used to derive novel insights about personality processes. Five studies converged on this idea. Study 1 revealed that people believed strangers who liked sweet foods (e. g., candy) were also higher in agreeableness. Studies 2 and 3 showed that individual differences in the preference for sweet foods predicted prosocial personalities, prosocial intentions, and prosocial behaviors. Studies 4 and 5 used experimental designs and showed that momentarily savoring a sweet food (vs. a nonsweet food or no food) increased participants' self-reports of agreeableness and helping behavior. The results reveal that an embodied metaphor approach provides a complementary but unique perspective to traditional trait views of personality.","[Meier, Brian P.; Riemer-Peltz, Miles] Gettysburg Coll, Dept Psychol, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA; [Moeller, Sara K.] St Xavier Univ, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60655 USA; [Robinson, Michael D.] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Psychol, Fargo, ND 58105 USA","Meier, BP (reprint author), Gettysburg Coll, Dept Psychol, Gettysburg, PA 17325 USA.",bmeier@gettysburg.edu,,,,,,102,43,49,7,73,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

As for vision, it is assumed that global processing broadens mental categories in memory, enhancing creativity. Furthermore, local processing should support performance in analytic tasks. Throughout separate 12 studies, participants were asked to look at, listen to, touch, taste or smell details of objects, or to perceive them as wholes. Global processing increased category breadth and creative relative to analytic performance, whereas for local processing the opposite was true.

This also affects the patient who has to cope with the reality of having a body that bursts into the subject's consciousness as a vital threat, as source of discomfort and inability and being a body (Marcel). The human body in its dual aspect has been and is a great unknown, if not a great outrage in spite of the fact that we are our body and our body is each of us. We sometimes do not feel as we are and thus a confrontation arises, sometimes more normal, others more morbid. This forces the physician to face complex ethics considerations and the scientist to accept a personal identity disorder. Dualism considers that there are two substances in us, one that distinguishes us from other beings and from the rest of the individuals of the human species, the soul, the psychic life, mind or consciousness, and another more insubstancial one, the body. The aim of the first substance is to dominate the body, to survive it after death when it is, already a corpse is meant to become putrefied, is buried, incinerated or thrown to the depth of the sea. This dualism aims to explain the origin of the evil and the attitude to defeat it and it does so efficiently. This anthropology has very ancient roots (the Upvanishads, in the orphic texts, in Plato), it is the core of Gnostic thought and the foundation of the modern science since Descartes. Some monist perspectives are a masked dualism or a mereologic fallacy, according to which, the brain is conscious, when that what is conscious is the subject, although the subject, with the brain could not be conscious. Therefore, a new perspective is proposed, chiasmatic or janicular monism, that considers the adaptive value of focusing on the reality from two perspectives, as physical universe and the world of interpersonal relationships. In the agnosias and in the phantom limb there is a confrontation between the body object and the body subject that has made it possible to investigate how the perception of the own body is and how the brain generates the schema and the body image. The study of the body experience, from the phenomenology and the anthropological psychiatry perspective, has made it possible to go greater in-depth into the knowledge of the alterations of the experience of the own body in different mental diseases, especially in those in which a confrontation between the body and the personal identity arises makes it necessary to consider the process of individual identification and a category of personal identity disorders that would include body dysmorphic disorder, erythrophobia, anorexia nervosa, body integrity identity as well as the gender-type disorders (transsexualism, non-fetishistic transvestism, gender identity disorder during childhood).","[Lopez-Ibor, Juan J.; Lopez-Ibor, Maria I.] Fdn Juan Jose Lopez Ibor, Madrid 28035, Spain; [Lopez-Ibor, Juan J.] Hosp Clin San Carlos, Inst Psiquiatria & Salud Mental, Madrid, Spain; [Lopez-Ibor, Juan J.; Ortiz, Tomas; Lopez-Ibor, Maria I.] Univ Complutense, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat, Madrid, Spain; [Lopez-Ibor, Juan J.; Ortiz, Tomas; Lopez-Ibor, Maria I.] CIBERSAM Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salad Mental, Madrid, Spain; [Lopez-Ibor, Juan J.] Inst Invest Sanitaria Hosp Clin San Carlos IdISSC, Madrid, Spain","Lopez-Ibor, JJ (reprint author), Fdn Juan Jose Lopez Ibor, C Dr Juan Jose Lopez Ibor 2, Madrid 28035, Spain.",secretariat@fundacionlopezibor.es,,,,,,1079,8,8,1,40,JUAN JOSE LOPEZ-IBOR FOUNDATION,MADRID,"NO 2, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",1139-9287,1578-2735,,ACTAS ESP PSIQUIATRI,Actas Esp.

Women have been found to be more susceptible than men to emotional contagion in certain contexts, but no studies examined the context of providing support to a troubled friend in a naturalistic setting. Our exploratory study aimed to test for gender differences in emotional contagion as a result of offering emotional support to a troubled friend. We studied naturalistic informal supportive interactions among 48 pairs of friends. Following an 8-min interaction with a troubled friend, (a) women were more likely than men to experience a deterioration in their positive emotional state and (b) changes in women's emotional state were positively correlated with changes in their troubled friends' emotional state, whereas changes in male support providers' emotional state were unrelated to changes in their troubled friends' emotional state. These results suggest that women are more susceptible than men to emotional contagion following brief interactions with a troubled friend, thereby highlighting the importance of conducting additional research into the costs and benefits of exchanging emotional support among friends.","[Magen, Eran] Univ Penn, Ctr Counseling & Psychol Serv, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Konasewich, Paul A.] Connect Leadership, San Mateo, CA USA","Magen, E (reprint author), Univ Penn, Ctr Counseling & Psychol Serv, 133 S 36th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",eranm@upenn.edu,,,,,,26,6,6,2,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0361-6843,,,PSYCHOL WOMEN QUART,Psychol.

Here evidence is presented for an alternative account, where a body focus does not diminish the attribution of all mental capacities but, instead, leads perceivers to infer a different kind of mind. Drawing on the distinction in mind perception between agency and experience, it is found that focusing on someone's body reduces perceptions of agency (self-control and action) but increases perceptions of experience (emotion and sensation). These effects were found when comparing targets represented by both revealing versus nonrevealing pictures (Experiments 1, 3, and 4) or by simply directing attention toward physical characteristics (Experiment 2). The effect of a body focus on mind perception also influenced moral intuitions, with those represented as a body seen to be less morally responsible (i.e., lesser moral agents) but more sensitive to harm (i.e., greater moral patients; Experiments 5 and 6). These effects suggest that a body focus does not cause objectification per se but, instead, leads to a redistribution of perceived mind.","[Gray, Kurt] Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Knobe, Joshua] Yale Univ, Dept Philosophy, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Sheskin, Mark; Bloom, Paul] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Barrett, Lisa Feldman] Northwestern Univ, Dept Psychol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Barrett, Lisa Feldman] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Mass Gen Hosp, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Gray, K (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",kurtgray@umd.edu,,"Sheskin, Mark/0000-0002-1277-8608; Knobe, Joshua/0000-0003-0733-3775",,,,64,94,97,3,79,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

One such signal is the open mouth play face that is common in primates and many other mammals. Unfortunately, as most play fighting involves biting, it can be ambiguous as to whether any instance of opening the mouth is performed to communicate playful intent or is simply a preparation for biting. In this study, open mouths co-occurring with the bared-teeth display (teeth-baring) in Tonkean macaques were used to assess the context in which facial gestures only relevant for signaling (i.e., teeth-baring is not necessary for biting) are used during play. Two predictions arising from the hypothesis that play signals are used to facilitate playful contact were tested: that the open mouth with teeth-baring should (1) be most frequent preceding contact, and (2) that it should be performed most often when bites are directed at orientations that is visible to the recipient. The data only partially support these predictions. The open mouth with teeth-baring is also frequently used when a monkey withdraws from playful contact. Moreover, it is associated with bites to body targets, such as the rump, that offer little prospect for detection by the recipient; this supports the possibility that play signals may sometimes be emitted not to communicate with the partner but with the performer itself. Thus, play signals serve multiple functions during play fighting.","[Pellis, Sergio M.; Pellis, Vivien C.; Reinhart, Christine J.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Neurosci, Canadian Ctr Behav Neurosci, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada; [Thierry, Bernard] Univ Strasbourg, Natl Rech Sci, Dept Ecol Physiol & Ethol, IPHC, Strasbourg, France","Pellis, SM (reprint author), Univ Lethbridge, Dept Neurosci, Canadian Ctr Behav Neurosci, 4401 Univ Dr, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",pellis@uleth.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC; Alberta Ingenuity Fund,"We thank the staff of the Primatology Centre and the Orangerie Zoo for their help and Devin Cahoon for his drawings of the monkeys.

Twenty-four musically trained and 24 untrained participants rated two-minute excerpts of pieces by Bach, Chopin, and Copland, each performed by the same pianist, who was asked to vary his stage behavior from minimal to natural to exaggerated. Participants rated the performances under either audio-only or audiovisual conditions. The composer's style had a consistently strong effect on the performance evaluations, highlighting the importance of careful repertoire selection. Moreover, the preferred degree of stage behavior depended on the style. The interaction between expertise, modality, and stage behavior revealed that non-musicians perceived differences across the three degrees of stage behavior only audiovisually and not in the audio-only condition. In contrast, musicians perceived these differences under both audiovisual and audio-only conditions, with the lowest ratings for minimal stage behavior. This suggests that varying the degree of stage behavior altered the quality of the performance. In addition, participants were asked to select two emotions that best characterized each performance. They preferentially chose more subtle emotions from Hevner's (1936) Adjective Circle over the five general emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and tenderness traditionally used in music cognition studies, suggesting that these five emotions are less apt to describe the emotions conveyed through musical performance.","[Krumhansl, Carol Lynne] Cornell Univ, Dept Psychol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Krumhansl, CL (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Psychol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",c.l.krumhansl@cornell.edu,,,,,,27,8,8,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1029-8649,,,MUSIC SCI,Music Sci.,NOV,2011,15,3,,,,,343,364,,10.1177/1029864911414172,,,,22,"Music; Psychology, Experimental",Music; Psychology,859YO,WOS:000297912000003,,,,,4/26/19

We demonstrate that emotion contagion occurs in teams even when communication is only text-based. We show that behaviors are perceived as emotionally charged, resolute behavior interpreted as a display of anger, and flexibility as a display of happiness. Moreover, we demonstrate that incongruence between text-based communication of emotion and emotionally charged behaviors elicits negative emotion in fellow teammates.

In contrast, according to abstract symbol theories, meaning arises from the syntactic combination of abstract, amodal symbols. If language is grounded in internal bodily states, then one would predict that emotion affects language. Consistent with this, advocates of embodied theories propose a strong link between emotion and language [Havas, D., Glenberg, A. M., & Rinck, M. Emotion simulation during language comprehension. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 14, 436-441, 2007; Niedenthal, P. M. Embodying emotion. Science, 316, 1002-1005, 2007]. The goal of this study was to test abstract symbol vs. embodied views of language by investigating whether mood affects semantic processing. To this aim, we induced different emotional states (happy vs. sad) by presenting film clips that displayed fragments from a happy movie or a sad movie. The clips were presented before and during blocks of sentences in which the cloze probability of mid-sentence critical words varied (high vs. low). Participants read sentences while ERPs were recorded. The mood induction procedure was successful: Participants watching the happy film clips scored higher on a mood scale than those watching the sad clips. For N400, mood by cloze probability interactions were obtained. The N400 cloze effect was strongly reduced in the sad mood compared with the happy mood condition. Furthermore, a difference in late positivity was only present for the sad mood condition.

Previous research has shown that when performing unilateral motor behavior that activates the affective and motivational systems of approach versus avoidance (arm flexion vs. extension), it is the congruence between laterality and motor activation that determines flexibility-rigidity functioning (Cretenet & Dru, 2009). When bilateral motor behaviors were performed, a mechanism of embodiment was revealed. It showed that the flexibility scores were determined by the match between the respective qualities of congruence of each of the unilateral motor behaviors performed. These results bring to light an overall embodied mechanism associated with the compatibility of the cognitive impact(s) of each motor behavior performed.","[Cretenet, Joel; Dru, Vincent] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre, UFR Sci & Technol Movement & Sports, Nanterre, France","Cretenet, J (reprint author), Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, UFR STAPS, 200 Av Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",joel.cretenet@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,98,2,2,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0364-0213,1551-6709,,COGNITIVE SCI,Cogn.

This theorizing yields four insights into the way emotions shape moral judgment. We submit that there are two kinds of specificity in the impact of emotion upon moral judgment: domain specificity and emotion specificity. We further contend that the unique embodied aspects of an emotion, such as nonverbal expressions and physiological responses, contribute to an emotion's impact on moral judgment. Finally, emotions play a key role in determining which issues acquire moral significance in a society over time, in a process known as moralization (Rozin, 1999). The implications of these four observations for future research on emotion and morality are discussed.","[Horberg, Elizabeth J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Inst Personal & Social Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Oveis, Christopher] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Keltner, Dacher] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Horberg, EJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Inst Personal & Social Res, 4135 Tolman Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",horberg@berkeley.edu,,,,,,62,73,74,6,45,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1754-0739,,,EMOT REV,Emot.

The approach system drives the organism toward stimuli or events in the environment, and the avoidance system instead deters the organism away from these stimuli or events. This approach-avoidance dichotomy has been central to theories of emotion. Advances in neuroscience complementing well-designed behavioral experiments have begun to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying approach-avoidance motivation, suggesting that these two systems exist in parallel and are lateralized in the brain.

Not only does linguistic information influence visual perception in real-time, but visual information also influences language comprehension in real-time. For example, in visual search tasks, incremental spoken delivery of the target features (e.g., ""Is there a red vertical?"") can increase the efficiency of conjunction search because only one feature is heard at a time. Moreover, in spoken word recognition tasks, the visual presence of an object whose name is similar to the word being spoken (e.g., a candle present when instructed to ""pick up the candy"") can alter the process of comprehension. Dense sampling methods, such as eye-tracking and reach-tracking, richly illustrate the nature of this interaction, providing a semi-continuous measure of the temporal dynamics of individual behavioral responses. We review a variety of studies that demonstrate how these methods are particularly promising in further elucidating the dynamic competition that takes place between underlying linguistic and visual representations in multimodal contexts, and we conclude with a discussion of the consequences that these findings have for theories of embodied cognition.

We investigated two such processes, perspective-taking and nonverbal mimicry. In Study 1, participants watched an embarrassed or unembarrassed confederate dancing to music while either remaining objective or engaging in perspective-taking. Both manipulations affected empathic embarrassment. Study 2 further examined the effects of targets' embarrassment displays and observers' prior experience with the situation upon spontaneous perspective-taking, expressive mimicry, and empathic embarrassment. Embarrassment displays increased mimicry, but also spontaneous perspective-taking and subsequent empathy. Prior experience moderated the effects of embarrassment displays on perspective-taking and empathy. Path analyses demonstrated that embarrassment displays exerted indirect effects on empathic embarrassment through both perspective-taking and mimicry. The results suggest that available affective and situational cues can activate different routes to empathy, and highlight the value of simultaneously investigating target- and observer-based sources of influence.","[Hawk, Skyler T.; Fischer, Agneta H.; Van Kleef, Gerben A.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Social Psychol, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Hawk, ST (reprint author), Res Ctr Adolescent Dev, Postbus 80-140, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",s.t.hawk@uu.nl,,,,,,55,31,32,1,38,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1528-3542,,,EMOTION,Emotion,JUN,2011,11,3,,,,,502,513,,10.1037/a0022762,,,,12,"Psychology, Experimental",Psychology,778NL,WOS:000291711300005,21668103,,,,4/26/19

The aim of the present study was to investigate in a healthy population a) whether facial pain behavior can indeed be operantly conditioned using a discriminative reinforcement schedule to increase and decrease facial pain behavior and b) to what extent these changes affect pain experience indexed by self-ratings. Methods: In the experimental group (n = 29), the participants were reinforced every time that they showed pain-indicative facial behavior (up-conditioning) or a neutral expression (down-conditioning) in response to painful heat stimulation. Once facial pain behavior was successfully up- or down-conditioned, respectively (which occurred in 72% of participants), facial pain displays and selfreport ratings were assessed. In addition, a control group (n = 11) was used that was yoked to the reinforcement plans of the experimental group. Results: During the conditioning phases, reinforcement led to significant changes in facial pain behavior in the majority of the experimental group (p <.001) but not in the yoked control group (p >.136). Fine-grained analyses of facial muscle movements revealed a similar picture. Furthermore, the decline in facial pain displays (as.observed during down-conditioning) strongly predicted changes in pain ratings (R(2) = 0.329). Conclusions: These results suggest that a) facial pain displays are sensitive to reinforcement and b) that changes in facial pain displays can affect self-report ratings.","[Kunz, Miriam; Lautenbacher, Stefan] Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany; [Kunz, Miriam; Rainville, Pierre] Univ Montreal, Dept Stomatol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Kunz, Miriam; Rainville, Pierre] Univ Montreal, Ctr Rech, Inst Univ Geriatrie Montreal, Quebec City, PQ, Canada","Kunz, M (reprint author), Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Markuspl 3, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany.",miriam.kunz@uni-bamberg.de,"Kunz, Miriam/P-8160-2016; Rainville, Pierre/M-5480-2015","Kunz, Miriam/0000-0002-0740-6738; Rainville, Pierre/0000-0001-9801-757X; , Stefan/0000-0002-2829-347X",University of Bamberg (Standige Kommission fur Forschung und wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchs (FNK)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [KU 2294/2],This study was supported by the commission for research of the University of Bamberg (Standige Kommission fur Forschung und wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchs (FNK)) and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (KU 2294/2).,,39,15,15,0,8,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106-3621 USA",0033-3174,,,PSYCHOSOM MED,Psychosom.

We examined whether this dysfunction persists in adulthood, and how brain activity in the mirror neuron system relates to social functioning outside the laboratory. Methods: Twenty-one adult males with autism spectrum disorders and 21 typically developing subjects matched for age, sex, and IQ were scanned in three conditions: observing short movies showing facial expressions, performing a facial movement, and experiencing a disgusting taste. Symptom severity and level of social adjustment were measured with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and the Social Functioning Scale. Results: Inferior frontal gyrus activity during the observation of facial expressions increased with age in subjects with autism, but not in control subjects. The age-related increase in activity was associated with changes in gaze behavior and improvements in social functioning. These age-related neurocognitive improvements were not found in a group of individuals with schizophrenia, who had comparable levels of social functioning. Conclusions: The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that mirror neuron system activity augments with age in autism and that this is accompanied by changes in gaze behavior and improved social functioning. It is the first demonstration of an age-related neurocognitive improvement in autism. Increased motor simulation may contribute to the amelioration in social functioning documented in adolescence and adulthood. This finding should encourage the development of new therapeutic interventions directed at emotion simulation.","[Thioux, Marc; Keysers, Christian] Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci, Social Brain Lab, Netherlands Inst Neurosci, NL-1105 BA Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bastiaansen, Jojanneke A.; Thioux, Marc; Nanetti, Luca; Keysers, Christian] Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Social Brain Lab, Dept Neurosci, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Bastiaansen, Jojanneke A.; Ketelaars, Cees] Autism Team N Netherlands, Lentis, Netherlands; [van der Gaag, Christiaan; Minderaa, Ruud] Univ Groningen, Dept Psychiat, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands","Keysers, C (reprint author), Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci, Social Brain Lab, Netherlands Inst Neurosci, Meibergdreef 47, NL-1105 BA Amsterdam, Netherlands.",c.keysers@nin.knaw.nl,"Bastiaansen, Jojanneke/F-4849-2013; Keysers, Christian/H-6251-2013","Bastiaansen, Jojanneke/0000-0003-4831-6402; Keysers, Christian/0000-0002-2845-5467",VIDI [452-04-305]; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(NWO) [400-08-089]; European Commission; Netherlands Brain Foundation [KS 2010(1)-29)],"The research was supported by a VIDI (No. 452-04-305) and an open competition grant (No. 400-08-089) from the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(NWO) and a Marie Curie Excellence Grant of the European Commission to CKey.

This article addresses this gap by jointly reviewing moderators of the reliance on both subtle affective feelings and cognitive feelings of ease-of-retrieval. The review revealed that moderators of the reliance on affective and cognitive feelings are remarkably similar and can be grouped into five major categories: (a) the salience of the feelings, (b) the representativeness of the feelings for the target, (c) the relevance of the feelings to the judgment, (d) the evaluative malleability of the judgment, and (e) the level of processing intensity. Based on the reviewed evidence, it is concluded that the use of feelings as information is a frequent event and a generally sensible judgmental strategy rather than a constant source of error.

The participants' ability to recognize the expression of shame among faces expressing different emotions was tested. They were then asked to perform a temporal bisection task involving both neutral and ashamed faces. The results showed that, from the age of 8 years, the participants who recognized the facial expressions of shame underestimated their presentation time compared to that of neutral faces. In contrast, no time distortion was observed in the children who did not recognize the ashamed faces or in those younger children who did recognize them. The results are discussed in terms of self-conscious emotions which develop to involve an attentional mechanism.","[Gil, Sandrine] Univ Poitiers, CNRS UMR 6234, Ctr Rech Langage & Apprentissage CeRCA, F-86000 Poitiers, France; [Droit-Volet, Sylvie] Univ Clermont Ferrand, Clermont Ferrand, France","Gil, S (reprint author), Univ Poitiers, CNRS UMR 6234, Ctr Rech Langage & Apprentissage CeRCA, 99 Ave Recteur Pineau, F-86000 Poitiers, France.",sandrine.gil@univ-poitiers.fr,,,,,,68,16,16,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-5564,1467-9450,,SCAND J PSYCHOL,Scand.

This study tested whether sequences of simulations of virtual action effects can be integrated into a meaning of their own. Cell phones were used to test this hypothesis because pressing a key on a phone is habitually associated with both digits (dialing numbers) and letters (typing text messages). In Experiment 1, dialing digit sequences induced the meaning of words that share the same key sequence (e.g., 5683, LOVE).

This study examined the voluntary facial action technique, where participants were instructed to react with the Zygomatic major muscle (smile) or the Corrugator supercilii muscle (frown) when exposed to different stimuli. The results demonstrate that the technique effectively induces facial feedback effects. Through use of this technique we further addressed three important areas of facial feedback and found, first, that facial feedback did not modulate the experience of positive and negative emotion evoking stimuli differently. Second, the modulating ability provided significant feedback effects, while the initiating ability did not. Third, an effect of feedback remained and could be detected even some time after the critical manipulation. It is concluded that the present technique can be used in the future study of facial feedback.","[Dimberg, Ulf; Soderkvist, Sven] Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, SE-75142 Uppsala, Sweden","Dimberg, U (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Psychol, Box 1225, SE-75142 Uppsala, Sweden.",ulf.dimberg@psyk.uu.se,,,,,,30,13,15,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0191-5886,,,J NONVERBAL BEHAV,J.

Until recently, research has almost exclusively examined the impact of music on body movements. Yet findings on embodied cognition in other domains suggest that the influence might also work in the opposite direction: Real or imagined body movements during music listening may codetermine music preferences. We had participants listen to music and concurrently activate muscles whose innervation has been shown to be associated with ""positive"" and ""negative"" affect (activation vs. inhibition of smiling muscles, vertical vs. horizontal head movements, and arm flexion vs. arm extension). Activation of the positively associated muscle groups led to higher preference ratings for the music pieces than activation of the negatively associated ones. A first exploration of candidate explanations for the effect suggests that it is most likely due to conditioning processes. It is concluded that body movements, both real and imagined, may play an important role in the development of music preferences.","[Sedlmeier, Peter; Weigelt, Oliver] Tech Univ Chemnitz, D-09107 Chemnitz, Germany; [Walther, Eva] Univ Trier, Trier, Germany","Sedlmeier, P (reprint author), Tech Univ Chemnitz, D-09107 Chemnitz, Germany.",peter.sedlmeier@psychologie.tu-chemnitz.de,,"Weigelt, Oliver/0000-0003-4328-3445",,,,44,15,15,2,35,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",0730-7829,,,MUSIC PERCEPT,Music Percept.,FEB,2011,28,3,,,,,297,305,,10.1525/MP.2011.28.3.297,,,,9,"Music; Psychology, Experimental",Music; Psychology,727DS,WOS:000287778400005,,,,,4/26/19

In this study, head shaking in early infancy and in adulthood was studied in a captive troop of spider monkeys, with a total of 8 infants studied from shortly after birth to just before weaning. Three hypotheses to account for these nonsocial headshakes were tested. The play as the experience of the unexpected hypothesis was found wanting because nonsocial headshakes were most common in early infancy, before the onset of the juvenile peak in play. The immature misdirection of signals hypothesis was also found wanting because the headshakes were correctly directed at other monkeys, but not at inanimate objects that were grabbed and mouthed. Both also failed to predict the occurrence of the observed nonsocial headshakes in adults. The hypothesis best supported by the data is that, under some situations, headshakes are self-directed to promote action when confronting contexts of uncertainty.","[Pellis, Sergio M.; Pellis, Vivien C.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Neurosci, Canadian Ctr Behav Neurosci, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada","Pellis, SM (reprint author), Univ Lethbridge, Dept Neurosci, Canadian Ctr Behav Neurosci, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",pellis@uleth.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"The research was supported by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to Sergio M.

They have biological bases and are shaped ontogenetically via learning and experience. Many situations and events of personal concern are social in nature. Thus, social exchanges play an important role in learning about rules and norms that shape regulation processes. I argue that (a) emotions often are actively auto-regulating-the behavior implied by the emotional reaction bias to the eliciting event or situation modifies or terminates the situation; (b) certain emotion components are likely to habituate dynamically, modifying the emotional states; (c) emotions are typically intra- and interpersonal processes at the same time, and modulating forces at these different levels interact; (d) emotions are not just regulated-they regulate. Important conclusions of my arguments are that the scientific analysis of emotion should not exclude regulatory processes, and that effortful emotion regulation should be seen relative to a backdrop of auto-regulation and habituation, and not the ideal notion of a neutral baseline. For all practical purposes unregulated emotion is not a realistic concept.","Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, D-28759 Bremen, Germany","Kappas, A (reprint author), Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",a.kappas@jacobs-university.de,"Kappas, Arvid/F-8224-2013","Kappas, Arvid/0000-0002-7715-8709",,,,84,47,49,0,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1754-0739,1754-0747,,EMOT REV,Emot.

Warmth and competence represent the central dimensions of group stereotypes, the majority of which are ambivalent - characterizing groups as warm but incompetent (e.g., older people, working mothers) or competent but cold (e.g., ""model minorities,"" female leaders), in turn eliciting ambivalent feelings (i.e.. pity and envy, respectively) and actions toward members of those groups. However, through nonverbal behaviors that subtly communicate warmth and competence information, people can manage the impressions they make on colleagues, potential employers, and possible investors.

For the case of coherence intuitions, a procedural account is theoretically derived and empirically tested assuming fluency and affect as driving mechanisms. Causally isolating and manipulating these mechanisms made it possible to influence, disable, and even reverse intuitions. This fluency-affect intuition model (FAIM) holds valid for intuitions of semantic coherence, Gestalt intuitions, and artificial grammar learning, and is likely valid for other phenomena such as stereotype disconfirmation or the feeling of knowing. Future research avenues for process models of other intuitive phenomena are discussed.","Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol 2, Roentgenring 10, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Topolinski, S (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol 2, Roentgenring 10, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",sascha.topolinski@psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,139,25,25,3,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1046-3283,1479-277X,,EUR REV SOC PSYCHOL,Eur.

However, much work is still needed to properly characterize these influences and the mechanisms by which they contribute to cognitive processing. An important question concerns the nature of emotional manipulations (i.e., direct induction of affectively valenced subjective experience) versus motivational manipulations (e.g., delivery of performance-contingent rewards and punishments) and their impact on cognitive control. Empirical evidence suggests that both kinds of manipulations can influence cognitive control in a systematic fashion, but investigations of both have largely been conducted independently of one another. Likewise, some theoretical accounts suggest that emotion and motivation may modulate cognitive control via common neural mechanisms, while others suggest the possibility of dissociable influences. Here, we provide an analysis and synthesis of these various accounts, suggesting potentially fruitful new research directions to test competing hypotheses.","[Chiew, Kimberly S.; Braver, Todd S.] Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Chiew, KS (reprint author), Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, Campus Box 1125, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",kschiew@wustl.edu,,"Chiew, Kimberly/0000-0003-3049-4059; Braver, Todd/0000-0002-2631-3393",NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH066078],,,112,68,74,0,37,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

For many decades following World War II, mainstream psychology researchers placed negative emotions (e. g., anxiety) ahead of positive emotions (e. g., happiness) but positive emotions are now a genuine, promising field of research because of their influence on specific components of performance (e. g., attention) and psychological well-being. The benefits of these emotions have hitherto not been wholly realized in a sport context, especially in their capacity to generate greater self-efficacy, motivation, attention, problem-solving, and coping with adversity. Although the sport emotion literature is sprinkled with studies that specifically examined positive emotion in sport settings, the breadth and depth of this research is too thin to make bold claims about the value of positive emotions in the emotion-performance relation. There are, however, at least three theoretical models available to sport psychologists to better understand the influence of positive emotions on sport performance and two of these models are specifically designed for sport contexts. Not only can these models deepen and widen this knowledge base, but they can also support interventions in applied settings to improve performance and psychological well-being.","Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Dept Psychol, Fac Sci, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland","McCarthy, PJ (reprint author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Dept Psychol, Fac Sci, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",paul.mccarthy@gcu.ac.uk,,,,,,149,45,46,0,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1750-984X,1750-9858,,INT REV SPORT EXER P,Int.

One promising idea is that people simulate concrete situations and introspective experiences to represent abstract concepts [Barsalou, L. W., & Wiemer-Hastings, K. (2005).

A second idea, which more researchers have investigated, is that people use metaphorical mappings from concrete to abstract concepts [Lakoff, G., & Johnson, M. (1980). Metaphors we live by. Chicago: Chicago University Press.]. According to this conceptual metaphor theory, image schemas structure and provide sensory-motor grounding for abstract concepts. Although there is evidence that people automatically activate image schemas when they process abstract concepts, we argue that situations are also needed to fully represent meaning.","[Pecher, Diane; Boot, Inge] Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Van Dantzig, Saskia] Leiden Univ, Dept Psychol, Leiden, Netherlands","Pecher, D (reprint author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,125,71,78,3,57,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0079-7421,,978-0-12-385527-5,PSYCHOL LEARN MOTIV,Psychol.

We used lag correlations to examine second-by-second coherence between subjective emotional experience and heart period within individuals across four different films. Participants were either: (a) experienced Vipassana meditators (attention to visceral sensations), (b) experienced dancers (attention to somatic sensations), and (c) controls with no meditation or dance experience. Results indicated a linear relationship in coherence, with meditators having highest levels, dancers having intermediary levels, and controls having lowest levels.

The motivational dimensional model, however, posits that positive affect is not a unitary construct with only one cognitive consequence. Instead, this model puts forth that there are different positive affects varying in approach motivational intensity. According to this model, only positive affects lower in motivational intensity should broaden cognitive processes, whereas positive affects higher in motivational intensity should narrow cognitive processes. Consistent with these predictions, high approach positive affect has been shown to narrow attention, whereas low approach positive affect has been shown to broaden it (Gable & Harmon-Jones, 2008). High approach positive affect, therefore, might narrow categorization. Two experiments investigated this possibility by having participants respond to cognitive categorization tasks in 3 body postures designed to elicit different levels of approach motivation: reclining backward, which should evoke low approach motivation; sitting upright, which should evoke moderate approach motivation; and leaning forward, which should evoke high approach motivation. Participants smiled while in each posture in order to experience positive affect.

The present study examines the relative impact of the main positive emotion regulation strategies on two components of well-being: positive affect (PA) and life satisfaction (LS). A total of 282 participants completed measures of PA. LS, overall happiness, and the savoring and dampening strategies they typically used. Results show that when experiencing positive events, focusing attention on the present moment and engaging in positive rumination promoted PA, whereas telling others promoted LS. In contrast, being distracted diminished PA, while focusing on negative details and engaging in negative rumination reduced LS. As the strategies targeted different components of well-being, our results further show that regulatory diversity (i.e., typically using various strategies rather than a few specific ones), was beneficial to overall happiness. Our findings suggest that there are several independent ways to make the best (or the worst) out of our positive emotions, and that the cultivation of multiple savoring strategies might be required to achieve lasting happiness.

Examining nonverbal behavior as an indirect measure of consumer response can enable retailers to better understand the needs of their customers. Nonverbal communication theory is used to develop a conceptual framework that builds on prior research on the situation, expressivity, social status, display rules, and their effects on customer expression. Lay wisdom suggests that customer expression should be revealing (e.g., ""the eyes are the windows to the soul""). However, research reveals a myriad of situational factors that may lead customers to mask their true feelings.

It assumes that the elicitation of emotion is fundamentally dependent on the social environment and that emotions go hand in hand with characteristic action tendencies. On this basis, it is argued that the facial expression of emotion is particularly implicated in generating patterns of social action and interaction. First, it is shown that the encoding of facial expression combines hard-wired physiological principles on the one hand and socially learned aspects on the other, leading to more fine-grained and socially differentiated ""dialects"" of emotional expression. Second, it is argued that the decoding of facial expression is contingent upon this combination, so that reciprocal attributions of emotional states, situational interpretations, and action tendencies are more effective within rather than across social units. Third, this conjunction affects the conditions for emotional contagion, which is shown to be more effective within social units exhibiting similar encoding and decoding characteristics and thus aligns emotions and action tendencies in a coherent, yet socially differentiated fashion. Taken together, these interactional processes show that emotions facilitate the structuring of social interaction and the emergence of social order.","Free Univ Berlin, Inst Soziol Exzellenzcluster Languages Emot, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","von Scheve, C (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Soziol Exzellenzcluster Languages Emot, Habelschwerdter Allee 45, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",scheve@zedat.fu-berlin.de,,,,,,99,4,4,0,8,LUCIUS LUCIUS VERLAG MBH,STUTTGART,"GEROKSTR 51, D-70184 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0340-1804,,,Z SOZIOL,Z.

In two studies, we examined moderating effects of a priori liking on the mimicry-liking link. Liking was measured via self-report measures (Studies 1 and 2) and behavioural measures using a virtual environment technology (Study 2). Results showed that when participants intentionally mimicked a disliked person, liking for that person was not improved, whereas when participants mimicked a liked person, liking for that person increased. These effects were shown to be mediated by affiliation.

And yet, these motor responses are often associated with a linguistic answer. Our hypothesis is that ""YES"" and ""NO"" verbal responses have a motor component. In a first experiment we showed that producing a verbal response (YES vs. NO) involves motor planning (pushing vs. pulling): participants push a lever more quickly when they have to answer ""yes"" than ""no"", and conversely, they pull a lever more quickly when they have to answer ""no"" than ""yes"". Moreover, in a second experiment, we showed that perceiving the words ""YES"" and ""NO"", on its own, leads to the same motor planning than when ""yes"" and ""no"" answers actually have to be produced. Participants detect the word ""YES"" faster when they have to push a lever than when they have to pull it and conversely they detect the word ""NO"" faster when they have to pull the lever than when they have to push it down.

William James's seminal paper in Mind (1884) proposed the idea that physiological and behavioral responses precede subjective experience in emotions that are marked by ""distinct bodily expression."" This notion has broadly inspired the investigation of emotion-specific autonomic nervous system activity, a research topic with great longevity. The trajectory of this literature is traced through its major theoretical challenges from the Cannon-Bard, activation, and Schachter-Singer theories, through its rich empirical history in the field of psychophysiology. Although these studies are marked by various findings, the overall trend of the research supports the notion of autonomic specificity for basic emotions. The construct of autonomic specificity continues to influence a number of core theoretical issues in affective science, such as the existence of basic or 'natural kinds' of emotion, the structure of affective space, the cognition-emotion relationship, and the function of emotion. Moreover, James's classic paper, which stimulated the emergence of psychology from philosophy and physiology in the latter nineteenth century, remains a dynamic force in contemporary emotion research.

However, there may be important qualifications to the link between the mind and the (peripheral) body. For example, the ability to sense internal and external bodily states declines in older age as does activation of physiological systems, all of which may contribute to an impairment in emotional experiences and how emotions influence behavior.

Recent evidence suggests that comprehension involves a mental simulation of sentence content that calls on the same neural systems used in literal action, perception, and emotion. In this study, we demonstrated that involuntary facial expression plays a causal role in the processing of emotional language. Subcutaneous injections of botulinum toxin-A (BTX) were used to temporarily paralyze the facial muscle used in frowning. We found that BTX selectively slowed the reading of sentences that described situations that normally require the paralyzed muscle for expressing the emotions evoked by the sentences. This finding demonstrates that peripheral feedback plays a role in language processing, supports facial-feedback theories of emotional cognition, and raises questions about the effects of BTX on cognition and emotional reactivity. We account for the role of facial feedback in language processing by considering neurophysiological mechanisms and reinforcement-learning theory.","[Havas, David A.; Glenberg, Arthur M.; Davidson, Richard J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Glenberg, Arthur M.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Gutowski, Karol A.; Lucarelli, Mark J.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med, Madison, WI USA; [Gutowski, Karol A.] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Havas, DA (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",dahavas@wisc.edu,,"Glenberg, Arthur/0000-0002-9281-3687","NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH043454-19, MH43454, R37 MH043454, R01 MH043454-20, R01 MH043454, P50-MH084051, R01 MH043454-21, P50 MH084051-01, P50 MH084051, P50 MH084051-02]",,,27,126,132,1,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,1467-9280,,PSYCHOL SCI,Psychol.

Here we directly tested this facial feedback hypothesis (FFH) by comparing the impact on self-reported emotional experience of BOTOX injections (which paralyze muscles of facial expression) and a control Restylane injection (which is a cosmetic filler that does not affect facial muscles). When examined alone, BOTOX participants showed no pre- to posttreatment changes in emotional responses to our most positive and negative video clips. Between-groups comparisons, however, showed that relative to controls, BOTOX participants exhibited an overall significant decrease in the strength of emotional experience. This result was attributable to (a) a pre- versus postdecrease in responses to mildly positive clips in the BOTOX group and (b) an unexpected increase in responses to negative clips in the Restylane control group. These data suggest that feedback from facial expressions is not necessary for emotional experience, but may influence emotional experience in some circumstances. These findings point to specific directions for future work clarifying the expression-experience relationship.","[Davis, Joshua Ian; Senghas, Ann] Columbia Univ Barnard Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Brandt, Fredric] Dermatol Res Inst, Coral Gables, FL USA; [Ochsner, Kevin N.] Columbia Univ, Dept Physiol, New York, NY 10027 USA","Davis, JI (reprint author), Columbia Univ Barnard Coll, Dept Psychol, 3009 Broadway,Milbank 415, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jdavis@barnard.edu,,,"NIMH NIH HHS [MH071637, R01 MH076137-04, R01 MH076137]",,,29,72,75,1,57,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1528-3542,1931-1516,,EMOTION,Emotion,JUN,2010,10,3,,,,,433,440,,10.1037/a0018690,,,,8,"Psychology, Experimental",Psychology,605WI,WOS:000278378200012,20515231,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,4/26/19

That people approach positive outcomes is not surprising, but do people also infer an outcome is rewarding from their bodily sensation of approaching it, and does this positivity transfer indirectly to other outcomes linked in memory to the original negative outcome? We posit that, because people usually approach reward, they mistakenly infer that approach must equal reward. Thus, a sensation of approach, even toward a negative outcome, makes them feel more positively toward the negative outcome and associated outcomes. Experiment 1 demonstrates a positive effect of embodied movement in space toward an otherwise aversive product. Experiments 2 and 3 additionally show positive effects of psychological movement in time, using evaluative conditioning procedures, to associated stimuli in memory.

Due to the conjoint development of image technology and brain imaging, the measurement of facial features and their combination as well as the understanding of their neural bases have greatly improved. In the same time, an important shift in perspective of facial deception has emerged in contemporary thinking with the development of evolutionary psychology. Deception and detection of deception have become a major asset in the adaptation of the individual to the environment. This does not mean that the delimitation between true and feigned emotions became easier. The purpose of the present paper is to examine the impact of these new findings on facial deception in clinical settings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Interest in emotion-related differences and age-associated changes in the processing of faces is growing. With the aim of systematically varying both expression and age of the face, we created FACES, a database comprising N = 171 naturalistic faces of young, middle-aged, and older women and men. Each face is represented with two sets of six facial expressions (neutrality, sadness, disgust, fear, anger, and happiness), resulting in 2,052 individual images. A total of N = 154 young, middle-aged, and older women and men rated the faces in terms of facial expression and perceived age. With its large age range of faces displaying different expressions, FACES is well suited for investigating developmental and other research questions on emotion, motivation, and cognition, as well as their interactions.

Consequently, fans as well as referees often rely on a variety of decision cues when judging Such foul situations. Based on embodiment research, which links perceptions of height to concepts of strength, power, and aggression, we argue that height is going to be one of the decision cues used. As a result, people are more likely to attribute a foul in an ambiguous tackle situation to the taller of two players. We find consistent support for our hypothesis, not only in field data spanning the last seven UEFA Champions League and German Bundesliga seasons, as well as the last three FIFA World Cups, but also in two experimental studies.

This article provides up-to-date information on fundamental properties and mechanisms of action of the major approved formulations of botulinum toxin type A, summarizes recent changes in naming conventions (nonproprietary names) mandated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and describes the reasons for these changes. The request for these changes provides recognition that formulations of botulinum toxins (eg, onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA) are not interchangeable and that dosing recommendations cannot be based on any one single conversion ratio. The extensive safety, tolerability, and efficacy data are summarized in detail, including the patient-reported outcomes that contribute to overall patient satisfaction and probability treatment continuation. Based on this in-depth review, the authors conclude that botulinum toxin type A treatment remains a cornerstone of facial aesthetic treatments, and clinicians must realize that techniques and dosing from one formulation cannot be applied to others, that each patient should undergo a full aesthetic evaluation, and that products and procedures must be selected in the context of individual needs and goals.","[De Boulle, Koenraad] Aalst Dermatol Clin, B-9300 Aalst, Belgium; [Glogau, Richard] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","De Boulle, K (reprint author), Aalst Dermatol Clin, 43 Leopoldlaan, B-9300 Aalst, Belgium.",koendeboulle@telenet.be,,,"Allergan, Inc., Irvine, USA","Editorial support was provided by Paula G.

Here, I attempt to sort out some of the disagreements between cognitivism and its rivals, adjudicating some disputes while showing that others are merely superficial. Looking at evidence from neuroscience and social psychology, as well as thought experiments and theoretical arguments, I conclude that it is necessary to acknowledge both that emotions have intentional content and that they involve somatic agitation.

It focuses, first, on the idea that during the perception of objects and people, action-based representations are automatically activated and, second, that such action representations can feed back and influence the perception of people and objects. For example, when one is merely viewing an object such as a coffee cup, the action it affords, such as a reach to grasp, is activated even though there is no intention to act on the object. Similarly, when one is observing a person's behaviour, their actions are automatically simulated, and such action simulation can influence our perception of the person and the object with which they interacted. The experiments to be described investigate the role of attention in such vision-to-action processes, the effects of such processes on emotion, and the role of a perceiver's body state in their interpretation of visual stimuli.","Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales","Tipper, SP (reprint author), Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales.",s.tipper@bangor.ac.uk,"Tipper, Steven/I-6884-2012","Tipper, Steven/0000-0002-1554-0531; Tipper, Steven Paul/0000-0002-7066-1117",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES-000-23-0429]; Wellcome Trust [071924/z/03/z],"The work described in this article was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC; RES-000-23-0429) and Wellcome Trust (071924/z/03/z).

As predicted, the authors found embodied reactions (i.e., increased electrodermal and corrugator activity) while participants unscrambled fear sentences. Importantly, these embodied reactions occurred in the absence of a subjective fear experience. In addition, the authors found increased electrodermal activity while viewing fear pictures and a stronger startle modulation effect after fear concept activation. Finally, concerning electrodermal activity, the results demonstrated that the effect of concept activation on subsequent emotional responding was fully mediated by participants' embodied reactions.

The emotion circumplex describes the circular spacing of emotions and has been harvested from covariation patterns among emotion words, self-reported emotional experience, and judgments of posed facial expression. The distance between emotions is a function of two orthogonal dimensions referred to as valence and arousal. In the present study, 79 participants' 19 affective social behaviors were coded in each of four dyadic social interactions. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that affective social behaviors exhibited a circular ordering consistent with a circumplex model. Multidimensional scaling provided evidence for the hypothesized two-dimensional valence and arousal factors. Correlations between circumplex factor scores and two personality measures provided validity evidence for the factors. This research is the first to show that naturally occurring affective social behavior conforms to a circumplex structure.","[Carney, Dana R.] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Business, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Colvin, C.

Specifically, participants were asked to think about and write down their best or worse qualities while they were sitting down with their back erect and pushing their chest out (confident posture) or slouched forward with their back curved (doubtful posture). Then, participants completed a number of measures and reported their self-evaluations. In line with the self-validation hypothesis, we predicted and found that the effect of the direction of thoughts (positive/negative) on self-related attitudes was significantly greater when participants wrote their thoughts in the confident than in the doubtful posture.

In the present study, 142 participants watched positive and negative video clips while either inhibiting their facial expressions or not. When hypothesis awareness and effects of distraction were experimentally controlled, inhibiting facial expressions weakened some emotional experiences.

When it is data driven (i.e., determined by the ease of committing the item to memory), JOLs decrease with study time (Koriat, Ma'ayan, & Nussinson, 2006). Because the amount of effort invested in different items is conjointly determined by data-driven and goal-driven regulation, an attribution process must be postulated in which variations in effort are attributed by the learner to data-driven or goal-driven regulation before the implications for metacognitive judgments are determined. To support the reality of this process, the authors asked learners to adopt a facial expression that creates a feeling of effort and induced them to attribute that effort either to data-driven or to goal-driven regulation. This manipulation was found to determine the direction in which experienced effort affected metacognitive judgment.","[Koriat, Asher] Univ Haifa, Dept Psychol, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel; [Nussinson, Ravit] Open Univ Israel, Dept Educ & Psychol, Raanana, Israel","Koriat, A (reprint author), Univ Haifa, Dept Psychol, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel.",Akoriat@Research.haifa.ac.il,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,We gratefully acknowledge support for this research by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the framework of German-Israeli Project Cooperation.

In this review article, the authors first describe existing evidence that being exposed to the suffering of a care recipient (conceptualized as psychological distress, physical symptoms, and existential/spiritual distress) directly influences caregivers' emotional experiences. Drawing from past theory and research, the authors propose that caregivers experience similar, complementary, and/or defensive emotions in response to care recipient suffering through mechanisms such as cognitive empathy, mimicry, and conditioned learning, placing caregivers at risk for psychological and physical morbidity. The authors then describe how gender, relationship closeness, caregiving efficacy, and individual differences in emotion regulation moderate these processes. Finally, the authors provide directions for future research to deepen understanding of interpersonal phenomena among older adults, and they discuss implications for clinical interventions to alleviate the suffering of both caregivers and care recipients.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Univ Ctr Social & Urban Res, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Schulz, R (reprint author), 121 Univ Pl, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",schulz@pitt.edu,,,"NINR NIH HHS [NR0009573, R01 NR008272-01, R01 NR008272, NR08272, R01 NR009573]; NIMH NIH HHS [MH071944, P30 MH071944]; NIA NIH HHS [F32 AG031635-01A2, R01 AG026010, F32 AG031635]; NHLBI NIH HHS [R24 HL076852, HL076858, HL076852, R24 HL076858]",,,179,84,87,1,31,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0882-7974,1939-1498,,PSYCHOL AGING,Psychol.

Four experiments showed that participants converged toward what they believed to be their specific ingroup's distinct emotional experience when reporting emotions as group members, but not when reporting emotions as individuals. Such self-stereotyping of ingroup emotions occurred for an experimentally fabricated ingroup as well as a range of naturally occurring groups. Demonstrating the roots of this process in categorization, self-stereotyping was increased when motivations to affiliate were amplified and was moderated by ingroup identification. The adoption of ingroup emotions changed participants' cognitive processing in a predictable way, demonstrating that emotional self-stereotyping involved the experience rather than merely the expression of group-based emotions. Self-stereotyping of ingroup emotions is thus one mechanism by which group-based emotions are shared and can be changed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To test this notion, two studies investigated the effects of bodily feedback from a gesture associated with power (making a fist) on the self-concept. As expected, making a fist led male participants to perceive themselves as more assertive and esteemed (Study 1) and to display stronger associations between the self-concept and power (Study 2), while these effects were absent among female participants. The gender difference may reflect that men are more prone to use physical force to gain social influence.

For example, manipulations of facial expression and posture appear to induce emotional states and influence how affective information is processed. The present study investigates whether performance monitoring, a cognitive process known to be under heavy control of the dopaminergic system, is modulated by induced facial expressions. In particular, we focused on the error-related negativity, an electrophysiological correlate of performance monitoring. Methods/Principal Findings: During a choice reaction task, participants held a Chinese chop stick either horizontally between the teeth (""smile'' condition) or, in different runs, vertically (""no smile'') with the upper lip. In a third control condition, no chop stick was used (""no stick''). It could be shown on a separate sample that the facial feedback procedure is feasible to induce mild changes in positive affect. In the ERP sample, the smile condition, hypothesized to lead to an increase in dopaminergic activity, was associated with a decrease of ERN amplitude relative to ""no smile'' and ""no stick'' conditions. Conclusion: Embodying emotions by induced facial expressions leads to a changes in the neural correlates of error detection.

However, current theories fail to explain how the subjective experience of spatial presence emerges from the unconscious spatial cognition processes. To fill this gap, spatial presence is conceptualized here as a cognitive feeling. From this perspective, spatial presence is a feedback from unconscious cognitive processes that informs conscious thought about the state of the spatial cognitive system. Current theorizing on the origins and properties of cognitive feelings is reviewed and applied to spatial presence. This new conception of presence draws attention to the functionality of spatial presence for judgments, decisions, and behavior. By highlighting the distinction between spatial cognitive processes and the subjective feeling of spatial presence, the use of questionnaires is theoretically grounded and legitimized as a method of presence research. Finally, embodied cognition theories are reviewed to identify cues that give rise to spatial presence.","Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands","Schubert, TW (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",schubert@igroup.org,,"Schubert, Thomas/0000-0002-3797-4568",,,,109,47,48,2,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1050-3293,1468-2885,,COMMUN THEOR,Commun.

Such work suggests that one consequence of perceiving an object is the automatic and covert motor simulation of acting on this object. This, in turn, provides individuals with information about how easy or hard this action would be. It transpires that we like to do what is easy, and we also prefer objects that are easier to act on. The notion that judgments of object likeability are driven by motoric information furthers embodied cognition theories by demonstrating that even our preferences are grounded in action.","[Ping, Raedy M.; Beilock, Sian L.] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Dhillon, Sonica] Northwestern Univ, Dept Psychol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Beilock, SL (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, 5848 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",beilock@uchicago.edu,,,,,,53,44,48,2,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1754-0739,1754-0747,,EMOT REV,Emot.

A review of recent literature as well as new experiments support five predictions derived from this framework. 1. Being in an emotional state congruent with sentence content facilitates sentence comprehension. 2. Because women are more reactive to sad events and men are more reactive to angry events, women understand sentences about sad events with greater facility than men, and men understand sentences about angry events with greater facility than women. 3. Because it takes time to shift from one emotion to another, reading a sad sentence slows the reading of a happy sentence more for women than men, whereas reading an angry sentence slows the reading of a happy sentence more for men than for women. 4. Because sad states motivate affiliative actions and angry states motivate aggressive action, gender and emotional content of sentences interact with the response mode. 5. Because emotion simulation requires particular action systems, adapting those action systems will affect comprehension of sentences with emotional content congruent with the adapted action system. These results have implications for the study of language, emotion, and gender differences.","[Glenberg, Arthur M.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Webster, Bryan J.; Mouilso, Emily; Havas, David; Lindeman, Lisa M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Glenberg, AM (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",glenberg@asu.edu,,"Glenberg, Arthur/0000-0002-9281-3687",,,,52,28,31,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1754-0739,,,EMOT REV,Emot.

This investigation focused on the transition to college, a time that presents a variety of emotional and social challenges. Analyses focused on 2 components of suppression: a stable component, representing individual differences expressed both before and after the transition, and a dynamic component, representing variance specific to the new college context. Both components of suppression predicted lower social support, less closeness to others, and lower social satisfaction. These findings were robustly corroborated across weekly experience reports, self-reports, and peer reports and are consistent with a theoretical framework that defines emotion regulation as a dynamic process shaped by both stable person factors and environmental demands.","[Srivastava, Sanjay] Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Tamir, Maya] Boston Coll, Dept Psychol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [McGonigal, Kelly M.; Gross, James J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [John, Oliver P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Srivastava, S (reprint author), 1227 Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",sanjay@uoregon.edu,,,"NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH58147, R01 MH058147]",,,57,199,205,3,56,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

A psychological mechanism for this effect is reviewed in which paralysis of the corrugator (frown) muscles leads to less facial feedback for negative emotions. Consequently, a negative affect is harder to maintain and so the person has a more positive mood. Methods In order to test this mechanism, the mood of patients who had received BTX-A treatment for glabelar frown lines was measured and compared with patients who had received other cosmetic treatments. Results The BTX-A-treated patients showed significantly less negative mood. Conclusion The results support the facial feedback view that frowning can make one unhappier.

Four experiments tested whether individuals' affective states moderate the expression of culturally normative cognitions and behaviors. We consistently found that value expressions, self-construals, and behaviors were less consistent with cultural norms when individuals were experiencing positive rather than negative affect. Positive affect allowed individuals to explore novel thoughts and behaviors that departed from cultural constraints, whereas negative affect bound people to cultural norms. As a result, when Westerners experienced positive rather than negative affect, they valued self-expression less, showed a greater preference for objects that reflected conformity, viewed the self in more interdependent terms, and sat closer to other people. East Asians showed the reverse pattern for each of these measures, valuing and expressing individuality and independence more when experiencing positive than when experiencing negative affect. The results suggest that affect serves an important functional purpose of attuning individuals more or less closely to their cultural heritage.","[Ashton-James, Claire E.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Psychol, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Galinsky, Adam D.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Chartrand, Tanya L.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA","Ashton-James, CE (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Psychol, 2136 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",cajames@psych.ubc.ca,"Maddux, William/B-3706-2010","Maddux, William/0000-0003-4218-5747",,,,32,20,21,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,1467-9280,,PSYCHOL SCI,Psychol.

As compared with satiated subjects, food-deprived subjects exhibited stronger activity in the zygomaticus muscle region when watching pictures of palatable foods (but not when watching positive control pictures). More important, hungry subjects exhibited weaker activity in the levator muscle region when watching pictures of unpalatable foods (but not when watching disgusting control pictures).

This review highlights the moderators of mimicry as well, including the social, motivational, and emotional conditions that foster or inhibit automatic mimicry. We interpret these findings in light of current theories of mimicry. First, we evaluate the evidence for and against mimicry as a communication tool. Second, we review neuropsychological research that sheds light on the question of how we mimic. What is the cognitive architecture that enables us to do what we perceive others do? We discuss a proposed system, the perception-behavior link, and the neurological evidence (i.e.,the mirror system) supporting it. We will then review the debate on whether mimicry is innate and inevitable. We propose that the architecture enabling mimicry is innate, but that the behavioral mimicry response may actually be (partly) a product of learning or associations.

Among the most viable categories for classifying emotion-regulation strategies are the targets and functions of emotion regulation.

The functions of emotion regulation include satisfying hedonic needs, supporting specific goal pursuits, and facilitating the global personality system. Emotion-regulation strategies are classified in terms of their targets and functions and relevant empirical work is reviewed.

Interestingly, the common procedure in previous research on affective lateralisation has been to measure hemispheric dominance following exposure to concrete affective stimuli. Therefore, prior research seems to tap primarily into the lateralisation of specific approach-avoidance motivations rather than diffuse affective states. The present research adopted an alternative methodological approach that excluded approach-avoidance motivations and merely studied the lateralised nature of diffuse affect. Participants evaluated ambiguous stimuli presented in either the right or left visual field. Results showed that stimuli presented in the left visual field were significantly more often ascribed a positive meaning compared to information in the right visual field. The present findings are compatible with related lateralised processes and underscore the necessity of distinguishing between specific motivations and diffuse affect.","[Koch, Severine] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Social & Cultural Psychol, Inst Behav Sci, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands","Koch, S (reprint author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Social & Cultural Psychol, Inst Behav Sci, POB 9104, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands.",S.Koch@bsi.ru.nl,"Holland, Rob/E-7885-2012","Koch, Severine/0000-0001-5328-2951",,,,30,1,1,1,14,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0269-9931,,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

It is unknown whether such facial mimicry takes place when the viewed emotion is a task irrelevant property of the face. The present experiment addressed this question by asking participants to judge either the emotional expression or the colour of a series of happy and angry faces that were either blue or yellow. Electromyographical recordings showed that when emotion was ignored, there was a tendency for facial muscle activity to be suppressed. Nonetheless, participants' facial expressions mimicked target expressions, with the zygomaticus cheek muscle being more active when viewing a smiling face and the corrugator brow muscle more active when viewing an angry face. These data support the automatic encoding of irrelevant emotional information, as well as suppression of emotional information by selective attention.","[Cannon, Peter R.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Psychol, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Cannon, Peter R.; Hayes, Amy E.; Tipper, Steven P.] Bangor Univ, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales","Cannon, PR (reprint author), Univ Plymouth, Sch Psychol, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",peter.cannon@plymouth.ac.uk,"Tipper, Steven/I-6884-2012","Tipper, Steven/0000-0002-1554-0531; Tipper, Steven Paul/0000-0002-7066-1117",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-23-0429],,,27,25,25,1,15,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0269-9931,,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

Keeping the translation as close as possible to the original English text and optimizing the factor loadings on the two components were the most important developmental issues. We used factor analyses with iterative communality estimation and Varimax rotation. Consistent with our goal, the values for internal consistency for suppression and reappraisal came very close to the values given for the original American version. We developed a tool that is easy to use with little time effort (5-10 min). Furthermore, it distinctly captures the two regulation styles suppression and reappraisal.

Memory is assumed to contain traces that reflect past experiences. The properties of these experiences are considered to be distributed across multiple neuronal systems, which are responsible, in particular, for sensorimotor and emotional processing. Memory is dynamic because knowledge emerges almost continuously from the activation and integration of these multimodal components. Memory is functional and situational because knowledge emerges from the subject's activity in a given situation, that is from a type of resonance between the properties of the past experiences that have shaped the neuronal networks and the properties of present experiences.","[Versace, Remy] Univ Lyon 2, Inst Psychol, Lab Etud Mecanismes Cognitifs, F-69676 Bron, France","Versace, R (reprint author), Univ Lyon 2, Inst Psychol, Lab Etud Mecanismes Cognitifs, 5 Ave Pierre Mendes France, F-69676 Bron, France.",remy.versace@univ-lyon2.fr,"VERSACE, Remy/H-3543-2017","VERSACE, Remy/0000-0002-4219-6617",,,,197,39,39,1,19,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0954-1446,1464-0635,,EUR J COGN PSYCHOL,Eur.

Moreover, rabbinic text is replete with observations that complement the empirical demonstrations of social psychology.

The act of deciding has been positioned as the quintessence of traditional decision theory, while actual enactment of the decided action within physical space by a corporal actor, with all that this entails, has been regarded as the obvious and, therefore, scientifically uninteresting result of having made up one's mind (cf. Bagozzi et al., 2003). However, recent discoveries made in the area of embodied cognition regarding the involvement of fundamentally motoric representations in long-presumed ""cognitive"" systems (Wilson, 2002) potentially turned conventional wisdom upside-down. In this chapter, we go beyond prominent theories of action selection and decision making to rethink the link between mind and body as it pertains to the relatively novel frontier of embodied decision making. In particular, we reconceptualize what it means to evaluate one's options in light of recent advancements in embodied cognition, motor control, and dynamic decision making. In the process, we provide a much needed account of the primary theoretical issues that any good account would seem to be impelled to address. Perhaps the greatest contribution provided by the present chapter is an organizing framework that we hope will guide future research to the eventual answer to what it means to be an embodied decision maker.","[DeCaro, Daniel A.; Johnson, Joseph G.] Miami Univ, Dept Psychol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Bar-Eli, Michael] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guildford Glazer Sch Business & Management, Dept Business Adm, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Conlin, Juliet A.] MPI Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Behav & Cognit, Berlin, Germany; [Diederich, Adele] Jacobs Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Bremen, Germany; [Plessner, Henning] Univ Leipzig, Inst Psychol 1, Leipzig, Germany","DeCaro, DA (reprint author), Miami Univ, Dept Psychol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",d_decaro@yahoo.com,"X, Simon/F-4678-2011",,,,,45,0,0,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0079-6123,,978-0-444-53356-2,PROG BRAIN RES,Prog.

We begin by offering a definition and review of implicit processes, including implicit cognition, motivation and affect. We then draw upon recent empirical research in psychology and neuroscience to make the case for a three category framework of implicit affect: (1) implicit sources of affect (2) implicit experiencing of affect and (3) implicit regulation of affect. To demonstrate the use of this framework in organizational scholarship, we present illustrative examples from organizational behavior research that represent each category. Given the limited amount of research in the organizational domain, we focus on demonstrating how an implicit affect perspective might alter or extend theoretical perspectives about a variety of organizational phenomena. We then discuss methodological options and challenges for studying implicit affect within the organizational domain. In sum, we provide a theoretical and methodological roadmap as well as a call for action for understanding the role of implicit affective processes in organizational behavior. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, much work in cognitive neuroscience has explored the brain systems engaged when perceivers share and make inferences about the internal states of social targets. These studies, however, typically use divergent and highly simplified stimuli and methods and as a consequence have produced largely non-overlapping sets of results and artificially constrained theories about the processes involved in perceivers' abilities to understand targets. Here we suggest that these difficulties may stem from two main sources: the lack of meaningful behavioral data about the brain bases of perceivers' accuracy in inferring target states and qualitative differences between the social stimuli used in neuroimaging paradigms and the social information perceivers encounter in the real world. We advocate more focus on studies of naturalistic social cognition, which could overcome these limitations and complement current approaches, and discuss work in our laboratory that has demonstrated the feasibility and utility of such a focus. Finally, we discuss the relevance of naturalistic social cognition to diagnosing and treating autism spectrum disorder. Overall, using naturalistic paradigms in neuroimaging will be critical to modeling the way the brain actually understands other minds.","[Zaki, Jamil; Ochsner, Kevin] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA",,jamil@psych.columbia.edu,"tobena, adolf/G-1032-2010",,National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [1R01DA022541-01]; Autism Speaks [4787],The authors wish to thank L.

However, a significant interaction between empathy and condition indicated that the high as compared to the low empathic group rated the films as being funnier in a happy condition and a tendency to be less funny in a sulky condition.

The first Study (Study 1) showed that participants judged valenced expressions according to the motor congruence model put forward by Cretenet and Dru (2004). This may depend on the compatibility of the valenced stimuli with the congruency of the bilateral motor behaviors that involved two unilateral motor behaviors that are congruent to each other. These results were duplicated in Study 2 with the use of valenced pictures taken from the International Affective Picture System. The overall results shed new light on the influence of motor behaviors on judgments, by determining the motor system as operative in evaluative mechanisms, and not merely a simple executive function of higher cognitive processes.

It was hypothesized that avoidance motor actions, relative to approach motor actions, increase the recruitment of cognitive resources, resulting in better performance on tasks that draw on these capacities. In Study 1, error rates on a verbal response mode version of the Stroop task were analyzed. On inconsistent Stroop trials, participants in the avoidance condition made significantly fewer errors than those in the approach condition. In Study 2, performance differences on a task switching paradigm were investigated. Crucially, approach and avoidance motor actions were manipulated within-subjects by alternating between approach and avoidance motor actions on 4 blocks of trials. Temporal switching costs were significantly lower while performing an avoidance, compared to an approach motor action. These results support our hypothesis that avoidance cues, relative to approach cues, lead to improved performance on cognitive control tasks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, results of three experiments show that refraining from responding to stimuli results in devaluation of these stimuli, but only when these stimuli are positive. These findings suggest automatic behavior-regulation, in terms of devaluation of positive stimuli, in situations in which environmental cues triggering approach (because of the positive valence of the stimulus) run counter to situational demands (cues that elicit behavioral inhibition).

The traits attributed to each person in a subsequent rating task depended on the fluency of participants' responses in a specitic manner. An individual more fluently identified while performing the academic action appeared more academic and less sporty. An individual more fluently identified while performing the sporty action appeared sportier. Thus, social perception is-at least partially-embodied.

Here we demonstrate that facial expressions of fear are configured to enhance sensory acquisition. A statistical model of expression appearance revealed that fear and disgust expressions have opposite shape and surface reflectance features. We hypothesized that this reflects a fundamental antagonism serving to augment versus diminish sensory exposure. In keeping with this hypothesis, when subjects posed expressions of fear, they had a subjectively larger visual field, faster eye movements during target localization and an increase in nasal volume and air velocity during inspiration. The opposite pattern was found for disgust. Fear may therefore work to enhance perception, whereas disgust dampens it. These convergent results provide support for the Darwinian hypothesis that facial expressions are not arbitrary configurations for social communication, but rather, expressions may have originated in altering the sensory interface with the physical world.","[Susskind, Joshua M.; Lee, Daniel H.; Cusi, Andree; Feiman, Roman; Grabski, Wojtek; Anderson, Adam K.] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Anderson, Adam K.] Baycrest Ctr Geriatr Care, Rotman Res Inst, Toronto, ON M6A 2E1, Canada","Susskind, JM (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",josh@aclab.ac; anderson@psych.utoronto.ca,,,,,,47,217,218,2,56,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1097-6256,1546-1726,,NAT NEUROSCI,Nat.

Two further studies investigated whether the fluency of another person's actions influences affective response. Observers watched movie clips of the motor actions described above, in conditions where the observed actor could be seen to be looking towards the grasped object, or where the actor's head and gaze were not visible. Two results were observed: First, when the actor's gaze cannot be seen, liking ratings of the objects are reduced. Second, action fluency of observed actions does influence liking ratings, but only when the actor's gaze towards the object is visible. These findings provide supporting evidence for the important role of observed eye gaze in action simulation, and demonstrate that non-emotive actions can evoke empathic states in observers.","[Hayes, Amy E.] Univ Coll N Wales, Sch Sport Hlth & Exercise Sci, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales; [Paul, Matthew A.; Beuger, Boukje; Tipper, Steven P.] Univ Coll N Wales, Ctr Clin & Cognit Neurosci, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales","Hayes, AE (reprint author), Univ Coll N Wales, Sch Sport Hlth & Exercise Sci, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales.",a.hayes@bangor.ac.uk,"Tipper, Steven/I-6884-2012","Tipper, Steven/0000-0002-1554-0531; Tipper, Steven Paul/0000-0002-7066-1117",Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-23-0429],,,41,34,34,1,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0340-0727,,,PSYCHOL RES-PSYCH FO,Psychol.

The use of botulinum toxin to pharmacologically alter upper face muscular expressiveness may curtail the appearance of negative emotions, most notably anger, but also fear and sadness. This Occurs via the relaxation of the corrugator supercilii and the procerus, which are responsible for brow furrowing, and to a lesser extent, because of the relaxation of the frontalis. Concurrently, botulinum toxin may dampen some positive expressions like the true smile, which requires activity of the orbicularis oculi, a muscle also relaxed after toxin injections. On balance, the evidence suggests that botulinum toxin injections for upper face dynamic creases may reduce negative facial expressions more than they reduce positive facial expressions. Based on the facial feedback hypothesis, this net change in facial expression may potentially have the secondary effect of reducing the internal experience of negative emotions, thus making patients feel less angry, sad, and fearful.","[Alam, Murad] Northwestern Univ, Sect Cutaneous & Aesthet Surg, Dept Dermatol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Alam, Murad] Northwestern Univ, Sect Cutaneous & Aesthet Surg, Dept Otolaryngol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Alam, Murad] Northwestern Univ, Sect Cutaneous & Aesthet Surg, Dept Surg, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Barrett, Karen C.] Colorado State Univ, Coll Appl Sci, Dept Human Dev & Family Studies, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Hodapp, Robert M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Peabody Coll, Dept Special Educ, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Arndt, Kenneth A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Arndt, Kenneth A.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Sect Cutaneous Oncol & Dermatol Surg, New Haven, CT USA; [Arndt, Kenneth A.] Dartmouth Coll, Hitchcock Med Ctr, Dartmouth Med Sch, Dept Med, Hanover, NH 03756 USA; [Arndt, Kenneth A.] SkinCare Phys Chestnut Hill, Chestnut Hill, MA USA","Alam, M (reprint author), Dept Dermatol, 676 N St Clair,Ste 1600, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",m-alam@northwestern.edu,,,,,,88,25,25,0,10,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0190-9622,,,J AM ACAD DERMATOL,J.

The results suggest that affective coherence has epistemic benefits and that incoherence is costly in terms of cognitive performance.","[Centerbar, David B.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Ctr Hlth Policy & Res, Shrewsbury, MA 01545 USA; [Schnall, Simone] Univ Plymouth, Sch Psychol, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Clore, Gerald L.] Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Garvin, Erika D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Centerbar, DB (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Ctr Hlth Policy & Res, 222 Maple Ave,Chang Bldg, Shrewsbury, MA 01545 USA.",david.centerbar@umassmed.edu; simone.schnall@plymouth.ac.uk,,,"NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH050074, MH50074, MH67580, R01 MH050074-09A1, R03 MH067580]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F001231/1]",,,76,30,31,2,23,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

The aim of the present study was to investigate how gender differences are related to different exposure times, representing information processing levels from subliminal (spontaneous) to supraliminal (emotionally regulated). Further, the study aimed at exploring correlations between verbally reported emotional contagion and facial responses for men and women. Masked pictures of angry, happy and sad facial expressions were presented to 102 participants (51 men) at exposure times from subliminal (23 ms) to clearly supraliminal (2500 ms). Myoelectric activity (EMG) from the corrugator and the zygomaticus was measured and the participants reported their hedonic tone (verbally reported emotional contagion) after stimulus exposures. The results showed an effect of exposure time on gender differences in facial responses as well as in verbally reported emotional contagion. Women amplified imitative responses towards happy vs. angry faces and verbally reported emotional contagion with prolonged exposure times, whereas men did not. No gender differences were detected at the subliminal or borderliminal exposure times, but at the supraliminal exposure gender differences were found in imitation as well as in verbally reported emotional contagion. Women showed correspondence between their facial responses and their verbally reported emotional contagion to a greater extent than men. The results were interpreted in terms of gender differences in emotion regulation, rather than as differences in biologically prepared emotional reactivity.","[Sonnby-Borgstrom, Marianne; Jonsson, Peter] Lund Univ, Dept Psychol, S-22460 Lund, Sweden; [Sonnby-Borgstrom, Marianne] Malmo Univ, Dept Hlth & Soc, Malmo, Sweden; [Svensson, Owe] Univ Lund Hosp, Lund, Sweden","Sonnby-Borgstrom, M (reprint author), Lund Univ, Dept Psychol, Ostervangsvagen 20, S-22460 Lund, Sweden.",marianne.sonnby-borgstrom@hs.mah.se,,,,,,84,35,35,2,25,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0036-5564,,,SCAND J PSYCHOL,Scand.

We examined whether the effects of social anxiety on positive emotions are moderated by tendencies to openly express or supress emotions. Over the course of a 3-month interval, people with excessive social anxiety endorsed stable, low levels of positive emotions. In addition, people with low social anxiety who frequently display their emotions openly, whether negative or positive, reported the greatest increases in positive emotions. Similar results were found when using a measure of emotion suppression (low social anxiety and less tendency to rely on these types of regulatory acts led to the greatest positive emotions). These social anxiety main and interactive effects could not be attributed to depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest that relations between social anxiety and positive emotional experiences over time are best understood in the context of meaningful individual differences such as affect regulatory strategies.","[Kashdan, Todd B.] George Mason Univ, Dept Psychol, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Kashdan, TB (reprint author), George Mason Univ, Dept Psychol, MS 3F5, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",tkashan@gmu.ed,,,NIMH NIH HHS [MH-73937],,,63,59,59,2,20,ASSOC ADV BEHAVIOR THERAPY,NEW YORK,"305 7TH AVE #16A, NEW YORK, NY 10001-6008 USA",0005-7894,,,BEHAV THER,Behav.

Many different theories of emotion have emerged since then, but it has been demonstrated that a specifically induced physiological state can influence an individual's emotional responses to stimuli. In the present study, auditory and/or vibrotactile heartbeat stimuli were presented to participants (N = 24), and the stimuli's effect on participants' physiological state and subsequent emotional attitude to affective pictures was measured. In particular, we aimed to investigate the effect of the perceived distance to stimuli on emotional experience. Distant versus close sound reproduction conditions (loudspeakers vs. headphones) were used to identify whether an ""'embodied"" experience can occur in which participants would associate the external heartbeat sound with their own. Vibrotactile stimulation of an experimental chair and footrest was added to magnify the experience. Participants' peripheral heartbeat signals, self-reported valence (pleasantness) and arousal (activation) ratings for the pictures, and memory performance scores were collected. Heartbeat sounds significantly affected participants' heartbeat, the emotional judgments of pictures, and their recall. The effect of distance to stimuli was observed in the significant interaction between the spatial location of the heartbeat sound and the vibrotactile stimulation, which was mainly caused by the auditory-vibrotactile interaction in the loudspeakers condition. This interaction might suggest that vibrations transform the far sound condition (sound via loudspeakers) in a close-stimulation condition and support the hypothesis that close sounds are more affective than distant ones. These findings have implications for the design and evaluation of mediated environments.","[Tajadura-Jimenez, Ana; Vaeljamaee, Aleksander] Chalmers, Div Appl Acoust, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Vaestfjaell, Daniel] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Psychol, Gothenburg, Sweden","Tajadura-Jimenez, A (reprint author), Chalmers, Div Appl Acoust, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",,"Valjamae, Aleksander/C-9952-2013; Tajadura-Jimenez, Ana/B-2355-2015","Valjamae, Aleksander/0000-0001-6071-3211; Tajadura-Jimenez, Ana/0000-0003-3166-3512; Vastfjall, Daniel/0000-0003-2873-4500",,,,30,8,8,0,10,MARY ANN LIEBERT INC,NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",1094-9313,,,CYBERPSYCHOL BEHAV,CyberPsychol.

Theories of grounded cognition are also reviewed, as are origins of the area and common misperceptions of it.

In part, this may be due to the lack of appropriate and proven behavioral intervention methods. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test a newly developed intervention method for its effectiveness to enhance cheerfulness and to improve aspects of psychological well-being and subjective health that may be advanced by increased levels of cheerfulness. Method: The key element of the Cheerfulness Training, which follows a behavioral therapy approach, is that imaginations of personal shortcomings, annoyances, and unpleasant situations are coupled with a self-induced positive affective state by conditioning processes. Results: Experimental findings demonstrated a pronounced enhancement of cheerfulness that was accompanied by reduced feelings of stress and improved psychological well-being and subjective health. Effects were stronger in participants with lower levels of trait seriousness. Conclusion: Findings indicate that the training is effective in enhancing cheerfulness and that successfully enhancing cheerfulness also promotes more general improvement of well-being.","[Papousek, Ilona; Schulter, Guenter] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Psychol, A-8010 Graz, Austria","Papousek, I (reprint author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Psychol, Univ Pl 2, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",ilona.papousek@uni-graz.at,,"Papousek, Ilona/0000-0002-6620-0318",,,,94,14,14,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1070-5503,1532-7558,,INT J BEHAV MED,Int.

In this view, preferences are frequently constructed in the moment and are susceptible to fleeting situational factors; problematically, individuals are insensitive to the impact of such factors on their behavior, misattributing utility caused by these irrelevant factors to stable underlying preferences. Consequently, subsequent behavior might reflect not hedonic utility but rather this erroneously imputed utility that lingers in memory. Here we review the roles of these streams of utility in shaping preferences, and discuss how neuroimaging offers unique possibilities for disentangling their independent contributions to behavior.","[Ariely, Dan] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Norton, Michael I.] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA","Ariely, D (reprint author), Duke Univ, 1 Towerview Rd, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",dandan@duke.edu; mnorton@hbs.edu,,,,,,40,118,119,3,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",1364-6613,1879-307X,,TRENDS COGN SCI,TRENDS COGN.

In line with prior research that suggested a link between power and approach tendencies, the authors hypothesized that having power increases confidence relative to being powerless. After demonstrating this link in Experiment 1, in 4 additional studies, they examined the role of power in persuasion as a function of when power is infused into the persuasion process. On the basis of the idea that power validates whatever mental content is accessible, they hypothesized that power would have different effects on persuasion depending on when power was induced. Specifically, the authors predicted that making people feel powerful prior to a message would validate their existing views and thus reduce the perceived need to attend to subsequent information. However, it was hypothesized that inducing power after a message has been processed would validate one's recently generated thoughts and thus influence the extent to which people rely upon their thoughts in determining their attitudes.","Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Social Psychol & Methodol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Univ San Pablo CEU Madrid, Dept Psychol, Madrid, Spain; Northwestern Univ, Dept Marketing, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Brinol, P (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Social Psychol & Methodol, Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",pablo.brinnol@uam.es,"Brinol, Pablo/B-7329-2011; Petty, Richard/A-5977-2008","Brinol, Pablo/0000-0002-0327-5865; Petty, Richard/0000-0002-2870-8575",,,,55,163,173,3,36,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

Embodied cognition theories suggest that mimicry reflects internal simulation of perceived emotion in order to facilitate its understanding. If so, blocking facial mimicry should impair recognition of expressions, especially of emotions that are simulated using facial musculature. The current research tested this hypothesis using four expressions (happy, disgust, fear, and sad) and two mimicry-interfering manipulations (1) biting on a pen and (2) chewing gum, as well as two control conditions. Experiment 1 used electromyography over cheek, mouth, and nose regions. The bite manipulation consistently activated assessed muscles, whereas the chew manipulation activated muscles only intermittently. Further, expressing happiness generated most facial action. Experiment 2 found that the bite manipulation interfered most with recognition of happiness. These findings suggest that facial mimicry differentially contributes to recognition of specific facial expressions, thus allowing for more refined predictions from embodied cognition theories.","[Oberman, Lindsay M.; Winklelman, Piotr; Ramachandran, Vilayanur S.] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Oberman, LM (reprint author), 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",loberman@ucsd.edu,"X, Simon/F-4678-2011","Winkielman, Piotr/0000-0003-2330-1802",,,,51,202,209,6,84,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND",1747-0919,,,SOC NEUROSCI,Soc.

Individuals typically overestimate duration represented by angry faces, probably due to increases in arousal (Droit-Volet, Brunot, & Niedenthal, 2004). Overestimation is not observed when imitation of the facial expressions is inhibited, suggesting that embodied simulation mediates the changes in arousal (Effron, Niedenthal, Gil, & Droit-Volet, 2006). This method thus provides an implicit measure of imitation and was used to test the hypothesis that individuals imitate in-group, but not out-group members' facial expressions of emotion. In separate studies Chinese and French Caucasian participants were presented with short (400 ms) and long (1600 ms) standard durations in a temporal bisection task. They then categorized standard and intermediate durations, represented by angry and neutral faces, in terms of similarity to the short and long standard durations. Half of the face stimuli were Chinese, and half Caucasian. Results revealed a bias in the temporal perception of emotion for the Caucasian participants when they were presented with Caucasian facial expressions and not Chinese ones. In contrast, this bias in time perception was observed when Chinese individuals imitated faces of both in- and out-group members. The results of the Chinese participants are interpreted in terms of familiarity with and motivations to understand the emotional expressions of members of a host culture.","[Mondillon, Laurie; Niedenthal, Paula M.; Gil, Sandrine; Drolt-Volet, Sylvie] Univ Clermont Ferrand, Clermont Ferrand, France","Mondillon, L (reprint author), Univ Clermont Ferrand, CNRS, Lab Psychol Sociale & Cognit, UMR 6024, F-63037 Clermont Ferrand, France.",laurie.mondillon@univ-bpclermont.fr,"X, Simon/F-4678-2011",,,,,81,27,29,1,26,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND",1747-0919,,,SOC NEUROSCI,Soc.

In Study 2B, participants who were instructed to engage in self-presentation felt happier after interacting with their romantic partner than participants who were not given this instruction, although other participants serving as forecasters did not anticipate such benefits. Increasing the generalizability of this self-presentation effect across contexts, the authors demonstrated that participants also underestimated how good they would feel before and after being evaluated by another person (Studies 3 and 4).

In Study 1, participants viewed moderately and intensely distressing, amusing, and neutral videos in social or nonsocial conditions. Smiling when distressed was most prevalent in conditions in which participants reported the greatest emotional distress. Specifically, while viewing distressing videos, men reported experiencing greater overall distress and also smiled more than women, especially in social conditions and while viewing intensely (as opposed to moderately) distressing stimuli. In general, smiling was related to more negative affect while viewing distressing videos but to more positive affect after viewing such stimuli. Study 2 explored raters' social Perceptions of participants from Study 1, confirming that people judge distressed smilers as less socially appropriate and less likable than nonsmilers.

The embodiment of emotion, when induced in human participants by manipulations of facial expression and posture in the laboratory, causally affects how emotional information is processed. Congruence between the recipient's bodily expression of emotion and the sender's emotional tone of language, for instance, facilitates comprehension of the communication, whereas incongruence can impair comprehension.

A series of experiments explore the notion that vision-action compatibility effects can influence personal-trait judgments. It is demonstrated that when ail observed individual carries out an action that is compatible with the participants' response, (1) this individual is identified more fluently, and (2) the observed individual's personality is attributed with the properties of the observed action. For example, if it is easier to identify one individual with a foot-response when he is seen kicking a ball, as compared to typing, he is perceived to be more 'sporty'. In contrast, if it is easier to identify one individual with a finger response when he is seen typing as compared to kicking a ball, he is associated with the 'academic' trait. These personal-trait judgment effects can be observed with explicit measures, where participants are asked to rate the sporty/academic nature of the person on a scale. They are also obtained when implicit measures are taken in a priming task, where participants are never explicitly asked to rate the personalities of the individuals. A control experiment rules out that these personal-trait effects are merely due to an association of motor responses (foot, finger) to individuals while identifying them, but that these effects depend on a prior manipulation of vision-action fluency.

In Study 2, participants were primed with fear or neutral expressions before reading vignettes featuring protagonists in mild distress. Fear-primed participants reported more sympathy and desire to help the protagonists than neutral-primed participants. Moreover, participants who recognised fear most accurately, as measured by a standard facial expression recognition task, showed the greatest increases in prosocial responding following fear expression primes.

Based on a definition of cognitive processes as those that mediate between variable input-output relations by means of representations, and the observation that the relation between stimuli and emotions is often variable, I argue that cognition is often involved in emotion and that cognitive methods are suited to study them. I further propose that the unique feature of emotion has to do with the content of the representations involved in the transition from stimulus input to emotion. Emotions are elicited when stimuli contain information about the satisfaction status of goals (i. e., when they are goal relevant). Given that cognitive methods are fit to study any representation-mediated process regardless of their content, they can a fortiori be used to study a process that operates on representations with goal-relevant content. I compare this process to processes that have no or a different relation to goals, including the process that deals with purely valenced information.","Univ Ghent, Dept Psychol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Moors, A (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Dept Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",agnes.moors@Ugent.ac.be,"Moors, Agnes/C-6342-2008; Davidson, Iain/A-9216-2011","Moors, Agnes/0000-0002-5137-557X; ",,,,93,29,29,0,9,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0269-9931,,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

Indeed, findings suggest that positively and negatively valenced stimuli trigger approach and avoidance movements automatically. However, affective stimulus-response compatibility phenomena share so many central characteristics with nonaffective stimulus-response compatibility phenomena that one may doubt whether the underlying mechanisms differ. We suggest an '' affectively enriched '' version of the theory of event coding (TEC) that is able to account for both affective and nonaffective compatibility, and that can account for the observation that both types of compatibility seem to be modulated by goals and intentions. Predictions from the model are tested in an experiment where participants carried out approach and avoidance responses to either the valence or the orientation of emotionally charged pictures. Under affective instruction the positive-approach/ negative-avoid mapping yielded faster responses than the positive-avoid/negativeapproach mapping, but no such effect was observed under spatial instruction. Conversely, spatial compatibility effects were obtained under spatial, but not under affective instruction. We conclude that affective and nonaffective compatibility effects reflect the same mechanism.","Leiden Univ, Dept Psychol, Cognit Psychol Unit, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands","Hommel, B (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Dept Psychol, Cognit Psychol Unit, Wassenaarseweg 52, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands.",hommel@fsw.leidenuniv.nl,"Hommel, Bernhard/F-8173-2010","Hommel, Bernhard/0000-0003-4731-5125",,,,58,90,93,0,17,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0269-9931,,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

Previously (Phaf & Rotteveel, 2005), we have argued that familiarity corresponds intrinsically to positive affect, and have extended the correspondence to novelty and negative affect. Here, we present two experiments that show reverse effects of affective manipulations on perceived familiarity. In Experiment 1 affectively valenced exteroceptive cues of approach and avoidance (e. g., apparent movement) modulated recognition bias of neutral targets. This finding suggests that our correspondence hypotheses can be generalised to an important aspect of emotion, namely approach and avoidance tendencies. In Experiment 2 participants' emotional mood was manipulated within the Jacoby-Whitehouse paradigm and a pattern of results was obtained as if consciousness was manipulated. We interpret the latter results within the affective modulation framework (AMF), which postulates facilitation of nonconscious processing by positive affect and an enhancement of conscious processing by negative affect.","Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands","Rotteveel, M (reprint author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.rotteveel@uva.nl,,,,,,77,18,18,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-9931,1464-0600,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

Thus, if typed, dyads of the former kind should create more motor interference than dyads of the latter kind. Although individuals could not explain how the dyads differed, skilled typists preferred those typed with different fingers. Novices showed no preference. Moreover, a motor task performed while making dyad preference judgments attenuated skilled typists' preference-but only when the motor task involved the specific fingers that would be used to type the dyads.

In this paper I will explore two aspects of the design plan that are of central relevance to the acquisition of warranted true beliefs. In the first place, perceptual beliefs were supposed to be taken in the basic way and should therefore constitute highly warranted true beliefs. Scale errors in young children pose serious problems for this argument, while they show that part of the visual system may be misguided by perceptual beliefs, as a normal part of the development of the human design plan. Secondly, the ascription of mental states to other persons does not depend on deductive or inductive inference from behaviour. However, the discovery of so-called mit Tor-neurons' suggests that motor simulation of observed behaviour plays a crucial role in understanding the intentions of others. I conclude by arguing for a refinement of the notion of 'design plan', guided by recent approaches in cognitive science that should make Plantinga's exterrialist account at least falsifiable.","Radboud Univ Nijmegen, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands","Van Elk, M (reprint author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, POB 9104, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands.",m.vanelk@nici.ru.nl,,,,,,16,0,0,0,1,PHILOSOPHICAL SOC SOUTHERN AFRICA,SOVENGA,"C/O DR D J LOUW, EDITOR, UNIV NORTH, DEPT PHILOSOPHY, PRIVATE BAG X1106, SOVENGA 0727, SOUTH AFRICA",0258-0136,,,S AFR J PHILOS,South Afr.

The influence of antecedent vs. response-focused strategy use on self-reported affect, physiological, and behavioural data were additionally investigated. A total of 82 healthy undergraduate participants were asked to use one of two response-focused emotion regulation techniques-suppression or exaggeration-while watching a 2 minute positive or negative movie. Following the movie, participants self-reported their affective response to the film, described how they tried to suppress or exaggerate their reaction (i.e., strategies used to regulate their response), and estimated the percentage of time they used each strategy. Representing ""antecedent"" and ""response-focused"" techniques, the strategies reported by participants were coded as ""cognitive"" or ""muscular"" in nature. Relative to exaggerators, participants in the suppression condition were significantly more likely to self-report using an antecedent (cognitive) strategy for at least some portion of the film (65% vs. 38%). During the suppression condition, greater use of antecedent strategies did not influence sympathetic reactivity to either movie but did result in significantly less self-reported negative affect to the negative movie.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Psychol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA","Demaree, HA (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Psychol, Mather Mem Bldg,Room 109,11220 Bellflower Rd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",Heath.Demaree@Case.edu,,,,,,27,27,27,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-9931,1464-0600,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

In Nussbaum's reading of the situation, the need to promote the creation of bonds of compassion-based solidarity between co-citizens provides material for an argument to restore the study of novels, in particular the realist social novel, to its former place near the centre of the curriculum in higher education. This paper argues that the unrivalled educational value that Nussbaum ascribes to the study of novels in this regard is compelling only when one fails to appreciate that rich imaginative involvement in another's aversive state is only one of many other psychological routes to compassion. The paper begins by sketching out Nussbaum's curricular proposal. After explaining how it presupposes what is labelled the perspective-taking/compassion hypothesis, I go on to catalogue the various psychological processes which are recognized in social psychology as playing a mediating role in the experience of compassion. In closing, I argue that the educational imperative of building up of bonds compassion-based solidarity between co-citizens calls for a curricular response more varied than Nussbaum's.","Univ Munster, Inst Gen Studies Educ 1, D-48143 Munster, Germany","Maxwell, B (reprint author), Univ Munster, Inst Gen Studies Educ 1, Georgskommende 26, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",maxwellb@uni-muenster.de,,,,,,54,5,5,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0305-7240,,,J MORAL EDUC,J.

Based on the biosocial theory of BPD, many of these mechanisms can be distilled down to the following process: the reduction of ineffective action tendencies linked with dysregulated emotions. Specifically we address the following interventions and associated mechanisms of change: mindfulness, validation, targeting and chain analysis. and dialectics. Patient change in BPD is conceptualized primarily as helping the patient to engage in functional, life-enhancing behavior, even when intense emotions are present.

Empirical studies found equivocal effects on psychological well-being which indicates that emotion work is a multidimensional construct with dimensions having positive and negative health effects. In the present studies, the following aspects of emotion work were differentiated: emotional regulation requirements: (1) the requirement to display positive emotions; (2) the requirement to display negative emotions, (3) the requirement to be sensitive to clients' emotions; (4) emotional dissonance: the expression of emotions that are not felt. Analyses were based on a representative sample (N = 184) of service workers and another sample of service workers (N = 1158) consisting of call centre agents, hotel and bank employees, and kindergarten teachers. The data showed that emotional dissonance was the stressful aspect of emotion work, whereas the display of positive emotions and sensitivity requirements also had positive effects on personal accomplishment. The requirement to express negative emotions had little effect on burnout.

The present research extends prior research on response modulation in two important ways. First, discrete indicators of cardiac vagal and sympathetic control (respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and pre-ejection period (PEP), respectively) were included as dependent measures along with interbeat interval (IBI) and skin conductance (EDR). Second, to help generalize results across response-focused modulation techniques, participants suppressed, exaggerated, or exerted no control over their responses while watching a disgust-elicifing film (for control purposes, a fourth group was asked to watch a neutral film naturally). Response modulation was associated with significantly decreased PEP (increased cardiac sympathetic control) relative to those in the natural-watch conditions. All participants evidenced increased EDR while watching the disgusting clip, but facial modulation did not produce EDR reactivity beyond that of watching the disgusting film naturally. Exaggerators experienced decreased IBI during modulation (perhaps due to increased muscle contraction) whereas all other groups showed increased IBI (i.e., the orienting response). Neither emotional experience nor facial modulation reliably impacted RSA, respiration rate, or inspiratory depth. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This kind of diffuse strategy has failed to capture the jointness of perception and action within and between people. In contradistinction, the authors offer a perspective that retains both integrally social features (e.g., involves interaction) and yet adequately exploits the current state of knowledge regarding the ecological properties of perception-action, while at the same time drawing on aspects of dynamic systems theory. In this article the authors review the best attempts to examine how one individual affects another's perceptions and actions in the emergence of a social unit of action. Two important approaches, the individual-level and cognitive dynamics approaches, have yielded insights that derive in significant degree from principles of ecological psychology and/or dynamical systems theory. Prototypic of the individual-level approach is a focus on what can be perceived by coactors with the aim of uncovering how the dispositional qualities (affordances) of another person are informationally specified during social interaction. In contrast, the cognitive dynamics approach simulates dynamical characteristics of cognition and psychological influence with the aim of uncovering how cooperative interaction emerges out of its component parts. The authors argue that these approaches involve, respectively, insufficient mutuality and insufficient embodiment. Consequently, a social synergy perspective is discussed that approaches the problem of socially cooperative interaction at the relational, nonreductive level, using novel methods to examine how social perception and action emerge through self-organizing processes.","Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Ctr Ecol Study Percept & Act, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; Coll Holy Cross, Dept Psychol, Worcester, MA 01610 USA","Marsh, KL (reprint author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Ctr Ecol Study Percept & Act, 406 Babbidge Rd,Unit 1020, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",Kerry.L.Marsh@uconn.edu,"Richardson, Michael/A-1277-2011","Richardson, Michael/0000-0001-9159-2774",,,,175,135,136,1,29,LAWRENCE ERLBAUM ASSOC INC,MAHWAH,"10 INDUSTRIAL AVE, MAHWAH, NJ 07430-2262 USA",1040-7413,,,ECOL PSYCHOL,Ecol.

Infants were randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG) that was presented an uninterrupted live-replay-live sequence of three 30-sec episodes of their mothers' communicative behavior using a double video TV paradigm, or to a control group (CG) that was presented an uninterrupted 90 sec of contingent maternal interactions. Infants of the EG grimaced more than infants of the CG only during the 2nd period of social exchange (replay vs. 2nd live period), but there was an increase of grimacing and a reduction in gazing during the 3rd period of televised interactions in infants of the CG. Each group was split into 2 subgroups a posteriori according to the presence or absence of smiling during the 1st contingent episode. Smiling infants of the EG reacted more negatively during the 2nd interaction period compared to other subgroups. These findings support the view that sensitivity, not fatigue or loss of interest to maternal stimulation, accounts for 2-month-olds' expressive changes during noncontingent maternal interactions; fatigue or loss of interest better explains the decline in attention and the increase of negative expressiveness during the last period of contingent interaction. The findings also suggest that the emotional climate of dyadic exchanges could be a contributing factor to infants' ability to detect the relations between their own actions and those of their social partners.","Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, CNRS, UMR 7593, Ctr Emot,Lab Vulnerabil Adaptat & Psychopathol, F-75013 Paris, France","Soussignan, R (reprint author), Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, CNRS, UMR 7593, Ctr Emot,Lab Vulnerabil Adaptat & Psychopathol, 47 Bd Hop,Pavillon Clerambault, F-75013 Paris, France.",soussign@ext.jussieu.fr,,,,,,48,31,31,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1525-0008,1532-7078,,INFANCY,Infancy,,2006,10,2,,,,,123,144,,10.1207/s15327078in1002_2,,,,22,"Psychology, Developmental",Psychology,088HS,WOS:000240803400002,,,,,4/26/19

Prior influential studies suggested that rudimentary attitudes could be established by simply pairing novel stimuli (Chinese ideographs) with arm flexion (approach) or arm extension (avoidance). In three experiments, we found that approach-avoidance actions alone were insufficient to account for such effects. Instead, we found that these affective influences resulted from the interaction of these actions with a priori differences in stimulus valence. Thus, with negative stimuli, the effect of extension on attitude was more positive than the effect of flexion. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the affect from motivationally compatible or incompatible action can also influence task evaluations. A final experiment, using Chinese ideographs from the original studies, confirmed these findings. Both approach and avoidance actions led to more positive evaluations of the ideographs when the actions were motivationally compatible with the prior valence of the ideographs. The attitudinal impact of approach-avoidance action thus reflects its situated meaning, which depends on the valence of stimuli being approached or avoided.","Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Centerbar, DB (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, 102 Gilmer Hall,POB 400400, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",dbc5b@virginia.edu,,,NIMH NIH HHS [MH-50074],,,29,77,83,0,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,1467-9280,,PSYCHOL SCI,Psychol.

Participants in one group received unanticipated startles. Participants in the other two groups were told that after a 20-s Countdown a loud noise would occur; participants in one of these groups were further told to inhibit their expressive behavior. Results indicated that startle suppression increased sympathetic activation.

It is possible for the robot to bootstrap from this imitative ability to infer the affective reaction of the human with whom it interacts and then use this affective assessment to guide its subsequent behavior. Our approach is heavily influenced by the ways human infants learn to communicate with their caregivers and come to understand the actions and expressive behavior of others in intentional and motivational terms. Specifically, our approach is guided by the hypothesis that imitative interactions beween infant and caregiver, starting with facial mimicry, are a significant stepping-stone to developing appropriate social bchavior, to predicting others' actions, and ultimately to understanding people as social beings.","MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Breazeal, C (reprint author), MIT, Media Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave,NE18,5th Floor, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",cynthiab@media.mit.edu; daphnq@media.mit.edu; jg@media.mit.edu; dagg@media.mit.edu; bruce@media.mit.edu,,,,,,86,101,102,1,19,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1064-5462,1530-9185,,ARTIF LIFE,Artif.

These results indicate that the mediating mechanisms underlying context effects on implicit measures can differ as a function of the task even when these tasks show similar effects on a superficial level.

The role of cheerfulness in American society grew in relation to modern ideological frameworks and various economic and social factors. Embraced by the middle class since the eighteenth century for reasons of social identity and philosophical outlook, cheerfulness became a national emotional standard perceived by outsiders of the culture as part of the American character. It was fostered by a tradition of optimism, self-reliance and self-centeredness. Being socially and individually beneficial, it was cultivated in the Victorian family. In the industrial age, cheerfulness was found to be economically productive and was administered in the workplace by the managerial leadership. The lower classes engaged in it through the job market and other social pressures. Cheerfulness escalated in business and corporate culture with competition. Thus, it proved to be the most useful of emotions in an increasingly rational culture and was individually sought and socially encouraged until it became the emotional highlight of the American social landscape. In late capitalism cheerfulness has been commodified, commercialized and recycled by media, possibly with some repercussions on depression.","NYU, Dept Culture & Commun, New York, NY 10003 USA","Kotchemidova, C (reprint author), NYU, Dept Culture & Commun, 239 Greene St,7th Floor, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,120,31,31,0,11,CARNEGIE MELLON UNIV PRESS,PITTSBURGH,"CARNEGIE MELLON UNIV J SOCIAL HIST, PITTSBURGH, PA 15213 USA",0022-4529,,,J SOC HIST,J.

Although this idea has been investigated in myriad ways, the understanding of how movements tune cognitive processes is still in its infancy. The present study examined the nonaffective tuning of movements (,arm extension and arm flexion) on heuristic and systematic processes. In a departure from recent cognitive tuning models, a model was derived that defines the tuning effect based on the movement goal and not on the movement position. In the experiment, participants moved toward an extension or flexion position with a movement goal which connected the movement with either an avoidance or an approach function. Analysis indicated that cognitive tuning is a product of the movement goal rather than the movement position. Implications for models of motor control as well as for cognitive tuning models are presented.","Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Behav & Cognit, Berlin, Germany; Univ Flensburg, Inst Movement Sci & Sport, Flensburg, Germany","Raab, M (reprint author), Auf Dem Campus 1, D-24943 Flensburg, Germany.",raab@uni-flensburg.de,"Raab, Markus/B-4919-2009","Raab, Markus/0000-0001-6546-1666",,,,27,21,21,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0031-5125,1558-688X,,PERCEPT MOTOR SKILL,Percept.

The current study sought to uncover the degree to which visual and verbal (conversation) interaction constrains and organizes the rhythmic limb movements of coactors. Two experiments were conducted in which pairs of participants completed an interpersonal puzzle task while swinging handheld pendulums with instructions that minimized intentional coordination but facilitated either visual or verbal interaction. Cross-spectral analysis revealed a higher degree of coordination for conditions in which the pairs were visually coupled. In contrast, verbal interaction alone was not found to provide a sufficient medium for unintentional coordination to occur, nor did it enhance the unintentional coordination that emerged during visual interaction. The results raise questions concerning differences between visual and verbal informational linkages during interaction and how these differences may affect interpersonal movement production and its coordination.","Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Ctr Ecol Study Percept & Act, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; Coll Holy Cross, Dept Psychol, Worcester, MA 01610 USA","Richardson, MJ (reprint author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol, Ctr Ecol Study Percept & Act, U-1020,406 Babbidge Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",michael.richardson@huskymail.uconn.edu,"Richardson, Michael/A-1277-2011","Richardson, Michael/0000-0001-9159-2774",,,,91,210,213,1,30,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0096-1523,,,J EXP PSYCHOL HUMAN,J.

Some of these researchers admit that emotions have feelings as components, but they insist that emotions contain other components as well, such as cognitions. I argue for a qualified version of the feeling theory. I present evidence in support William James's conjecture that emotions are perceptions of patterned changes in the body. When such perceptions are conscious, they qualify as feelings. But the bodily perceptions constituting emotions can occur unconsciously. When that occurs, emotions are unfelt. Thus, emotions are feelings when conscious, and they are not feelings when unconscious.

Although many empirical demonstrations of social embodiment exist, no particularly compelling account of them has been offered. We propose that theories of embodied cognition, such as the Perceptual Symbol Systems (PSS) account (Barsalou, 1999), explain and integrate these findings, and that they also suggest exciting new directions for research.

Facial reactions to the film were video-recorded and subsequently rated in terms of facial affect. Participants also self-reported the valence of their emotional experience. Results from regression analyses revealed that persons with low resting RSA behaviorally evidenced a more negative facial response to the negative film under natural-watch conditions. Low RSA individuals were also less able to modulate (i.e., amplify) their facial response to the negative film. In terms of self-report measures, persons in the exaggerate condition reported more positive affect to the positive film than did those in the natural-watch condition.

In this paper, we examine these areas and suggest that affect in groups, as well as specific mechanisms to regulate and maintain certain affective states in groups, have had important roles in promoting group survival over evolutionary history. Specifically, we suggest that affect in groups serves a coordination function, which can take one of two forms. First, affect in groups quickly provides information about the environment and group structure to other group members, thus coordinating group activity via a communication function. Second, shared affect in groups coordinates group activity through fostering group bonds and group loyalty. These two functions of affect in groups are closely related and mutually reinforcing.

In the first experiment, two groups of participants, with different levels of induced physiological arousal, rated four excerpts of music on 10 emotion scales in terms of the emotion they felt while listening to the music and the emotion they thought the music was intended to express. Participants who had exercised immediately before making the emotion judgments reported more intense experiences of emotion felt while listening to the music than did participants who had relaxed. Arousal manipulation had no effect on ratings of the emotion thought to be expressed by the music. These results suggest that arousal influences the intensity of emotion experienced with music and therefore that people use their body state as information about the emotion felt while listening to music. A second experiment investigated this effect in more detail. Independent groups were used to test three different types of induced arousal, with separate groups for ratings of emotion felt and emotion expressed by the music. Participants who had exercised reported intensified experience of positive emotions, in response to pieces that were positive in valence, than did a control group. The article concludes that body state can influence emotional experience with music and presents this as evidence for the role of personal and situational factors in the emotional experience of music.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Mus, Sheffield S10 5BR, S Yorkshire, England","Dibben, N (reprint author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Mus, 38 Taptonville Rd, Sheffield S10 5BR, S Yorkshire, England.",n.j.dibben@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Dibben, Nicola/0000-0002-9250-5035",,,,46,34,35,1,10,UNIV CALIF PRESS,BERKELEY,"C/O JOURNALS DIVISION, 2000 CENTER ST, STE 303, BERKELEY, CA 94704-1223 USA",0730-7829,,,MUSIC PERCEPT,Music Percept.,FAL,2004,22,1,,,,,79,115,,10.1525/mp.2004.22.1.79,,,,37,"Music; Psychology, Experimental",Music; Psychology,850SY,WOS:000223634000004,,,,,4/26/19

Supporting these hypotheses, it was found that unobtrusively inducing behavior related to bodily force (making a fist) activated the concept of power in a Stroop task for both genders but that it increased hope for power and positive judgments of an assertively acting target for men, whereas it decreased hope for power and led to negative judgments Of an assertively acting target for women.","Univ Jena, Lehrstuhl Sozialpsychol, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Schubert, TW (reprint author), Univ Jena, Lehrstuhl Sozialpsychol, Humboldtstr 26, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",schubert@igroup.org,,"Schubert, Thomas/0000-0002-3797-4568",,,,56,68,69,1,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0146-1672,1552-7433,,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

All of us organize our experience in the form of narratives in order to give meaning to events, make forecasts about how situations will evolve, guide our actions in relationships and make our self-experience coherent. Here we present a theoretical model which starts out from the hypothesis that, when they are created, the narratives we continuously relate to ourselves and others do not have a pre-existing form. We propose a model for understanding the way each organizational level is formed in the mind, and works and interacts with other levels; and what psychological disorders could affect it, ranging from the basic, where there are simple aggregates of mental images, to the more complex, where there are true and proper stories, in which the characters of the internal scenario interact with each other. According to our model, it is possible to hypothesize the existence of (1) a pre-narrative level, and (2) a proto-narrative level, followed by three extended narrative levels: (3) a procedural unconscious narrative level, (4) a conscious propositional narrative level, and (5) a verbal interactive narrative level. Our hypothesis is based on: (1) a review of various theories from different fields of research; and (2) illustrative clinical material obtained by recording psychotherapy sessions with severely personality-disordered patients.","Assoc Psicol Cognit APC, Training Sch Psychotherapy, Terzo Ctr Psicoterapia Cognit, I-00161 Rome, Italy","Dimaggio, G (reprint author), Assoc Psicol Cognit APC, Training Sch Psychotherapy, Terzo Ctr Psicoterapia Cognit, Via Ravenna 9-C, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",ann.digi@tiscali.it,,,,,,102,25,25,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1476-0835,2044-8341,,PSYCHOL PSYCHOTHER-T,Psychol.

The authors build on this framework to argue that organizational compassion exists when members of a system collectively notice, feel, and respond to pain experienced by members of that system. These processes become collective as features of an organization's context legitimate them within the organization, propagate them among organizational members, and coordinate them across individuals.","Univ Michigan, Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada","Kanov, JM (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,69,168,172,3,49,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-7642,,,AM BEHAV SCI,Am.

Induced nodding led to more favorable evaluations of positively valenced products but did not affect the evaluation of negatively valenced ones. Similarly, head shaking led to more unfavorable evaluations of negatively valenced products but did not affect the evaluation of positive ones. In Study 2, participants evaluated positively valenced products more favorably when they flexed their arms while making the evaluation and evaluated negatively valenced products more unfavorably when they extended their arms during evaluation. However, arm flexion had no effect on evaluations of negative products, and arm extensions had no effect on evaluations of positive ones.

In particular it is assumed that social behavior is controlled by 2 interacting systems that follow different operating principles. The reflective system generates behavioral decisions that are based on knowledge about facts and values, whereas the impulsive system elicits behavior through associative links and motivational orientations. The proposed model describes how the 2 systems interact at various stages of processing, and how their outputs may determine behavior in a synergistic or antagonistic fashion. It extends previous models by integrating motivational components that allow more precise predictions of behavior The implications of this reflective-impulsive model are applied to various phenomena from social psychology and beyond. Extending previous dual-process accounts, this model is not limited to specific domains of mental functioning and attempts to integrate cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms.","Univ Wurzburg, Lehrstuhl Psychol 2, Dept Psychol, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Strack, F (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Lehrstuhl Psychol 2, Dept Psychol, Rontgenring 10, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",strack@psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de; deutsch@psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de,"Strack, Fritz/B-9366-2009",,,,,187,1713,1733,21,365,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1088-8683,1532-7957,,PERS SOC PSYCHOL REV,Pers.

Do some emotion regulation strategies have more to recommend them than others'? According to Gross's (1998, Review of General Psychology, 2, 271-299) process model of emotion regulation, strategies that act early in the emotion-generative process should have a different profile of consequences than strategies that act later on. This review focuses on two commonly used strategies for down-regulating emotion. The first, reappraisal, comes early in the emotion-generative process. It consists of changing the way a situation is construed so as to decrease its emotional impact. The second, suppression, comes later in the emotion-generative process. It consists of inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings. Experimental and individual-difference studies find reappraisal is often more effective than suppression. Reappraisal decreases emotion experience and behavioral expression, and has no impact on memory. By contrast, Suppression decreases behavioral expression, but fails to decrease emotion experience, and actually impairs memory. Suppression also increases physiological responding for suppressors and their social partners. This review concludes with a consideration of five important directions for future research on emotion regulation processes.","Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Gross, JJ (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",james@psych.stanford.edu,,,NIMH NIH HHS [MH58147],,,86,1458,1539,23,440,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0048-5772,1469-8986,,PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY,Psychophysiology,MAY,2002,39,3,,,,,281,291,,10.1017/S0048577201393198,,,,11,"Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental",Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology,548ZC,WOS:000175419200002,12212647,Bronze,,,4/26/19

Participants were asked to hold a pencil in their mouth to either facilitate or inhibit smiles and were not instructed to contract specific muscles. Five conditions-namely lips pressing, low-level non-Duchenne smiling, high-level non-Duchenne smiling, Duchenne smiling, and control-were produced while participants watched videoclips that were evocative of positive or negative affect. Participants who displayed Duchenne smiles reported more positive experience when pleasant scenes and humorous cartoons were presented. Furthermore, they tended to exhibit different patterns of autonomic arousal when viewing positive scenes. These results support the facial feedback hypothesis and suggest that facial feedback has more powerful effects when facial configurations represent valid analogs of basic emotional expressions.","Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, CNRS, UMR 7593, Lab Vulnerabil Adaptat & Psychopathol, F-75013 Paris, France","Soussignan, R (reprint author), Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, CNRS, UMR 7593, Lab Vulnerabil Adaptat & Psychopathol, Pavillon Clerambault,47 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",soussign@ext.jussieu.fr,,,,,,77,125,130,9,65,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1528-3542,,,EMOTION,Emotion,MAR,2002,2,1,,,,,52,74,,10.1037/1528-3542.2.1.52,,,,23,"Psychology, Experimental",Psychology,V21RJ,WOS:000208224400004,12899366,,,,4/26/19

In Experiments I and 2, bodily cues associated with positive or negative hedonic states were manipulated by means of arm flexor or extensor contraction, respectively, and the effects of these internal cues on creative insight and generation were observed. In line with our cognitive tuning approach, it was predicted that the ""riskier,"" more explorative processing style elicited by arm flexion, relative to the more risk-averse, perseverant processing style elicited by arm extension, would facilitate performance on both tasks. These predictions were strongly supported., In addition, Experiments 3 and 4 provided the first direct evidence that the effects of these internal processing cues on creativity are mediated by a memory search-based mechanism. Reported effects were independent of mood, task enjoyment, and the effortfulness of the motor actions.

Previous research on bodily feedback (Cacioppo, Priester & Berntson, 1993) has provided evidence associating arm flexion with approach behavior and arm extension with avoidance behavior, and demonstrated that these strategic inclinations have an effect on judgment. The findings of the present study show that participants in an arm flexion condition (induced approach behavior) consider the FDP a nicer and more competent political party than participants in an arm extension condition (induced avoidance behavior). Furthermore, approach behavior participants give a better election prognosis for the FDP than avoidance behavior participants.

This result was obtained using a new method for inducing mood states unobtrusively and with minimal or no cognitive concomitants. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that for participants who were exposed to positive feedback a pre-existing positive mood led to stronger feelings of pride in comparison to negative mood. The results of Experiments 2 and 3 suggest that pre-existing mood directly influences the experience of subsequently elicited emotions independent of what one knows about the causes of this feeling. When participants were required to differentiate between the funniness of a cartoon and their subjective humour response, mood influenced only the latter judgement (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, reminding participants of the mood induction resulted in a contrast effect in judging the funniness of a cartoon. However, the pre-existing mood continued to exert an assimilation effect on the overt mirth response. In conclusion, these results suggest that the feeling and knowledge component are partly independent bases of emotional responses.","Univ Wurzburg, Lehrstuhl Psychol 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Neumann, R (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Lehrstuhl Psychol 2, Rontgenring 10, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",,"Strack, Fritz/B-9366-2009","Seibt, Beate/0000-0002-0148-0961",,,,39,38,38,0,11,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0269-9931,,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

In this article we propose an organizing model for understanding these affective influences and their effects on group life. We begin with individual-level affective characteristics that members bring to their groups: moods, emotions, sentiments, and emotional intelligence. These affective characteristics then combine to form a group's affective composition. We discuss explicit and implicit processes through which this affective combination occurs by examining the research on emotional contagion, entrainment, modeling, and the manipulation of affect. We also explore how elements of the affective context, such as organization-wide emotion norms and the group's particular emotional history, may serve to constrain or amplify group members' emotions. The outcome, group emotion, results from the combination of the group's affective composition and the affective context in which the group is behaving. Last, we focus on the important interaction between nonaffective factors and affective factors in group life and suggest a possible agenda for future research.

The gender of the viewer had weak effects. We hypothesize that this fast and repeatable reaction is likely to have a 'prewired' neural basis. We propose that the induction of emotional processes within a subject by the perception of emotionally expressive faces is a powerful instrument in the detection of emotional states in others and as the basis for one's own reactions. Detailed knowledge of emotional reactions to faces is also valuable as a basis for psychiatric studies of disorders in affect and/or communication and in studies using functional imaging (fMRI or PET) when faces are increasingly used as stimuli.

Eighty people were first induced to adopt emotional expressions in a successfully disguised procedure that identified whether their feelings were affected by their expressive behaviour when they were unaware of the nature and purpose of that behaviour. They then deliberately attempted to change emotional feelings by adopting or inhibiting emotional behaviours, or by focusing on or being distracted from situational cues for emotion. Participants more responsive to their own behaviour in the disguised procedure felt more intensely when they adopted emotional behaviours, and less intensely when they inhibited those behaviours. In contrast, people identified as unresponsive to their own emotional behaviour were most affected by deliberate focus on or distraction from emotional thoughts.

To measure participants' differential cognitive capacities, a dual task paradigm was used including a finger-dexterity test as a secondary task. We were able to show that participants per;formed worse on the secondary task compared to a baseline assessed before if there was incompatibility between postures and the valence of the information.

Plasticity in the central circuitry of emotion is considered, and implications of data showing experience-induced changes in the hippocampus for understanding psychopathology and stress-related symptoms are discussed. Two key forms of affective plasticity are described-context and regulation. A role for the hippocampus in context-dependent normal and dysfunctional emotional responding is proposed.

Specifically, the authors predicted that arm flexion would elicit a heuristic processing strategy and bolster insight processes, whereas arm extension would elicit a systematic processing strategy and impair insight processes. To test these predictions, the authors assessed the effects of these motor actions on 3 central elements of creative insight: contextual set-breaking, restructuring, and mental search. As predicted, in 6 experiments, arm flexion, relative to arm extension, facilitated insight-related processes. In a 7th experiment, arm extension, relative to arm flexion, facilitated analytical reasoning, supporting a cognitive tuning interpretation of the findings.","Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; Univ Wurzburg, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Friedman, RS (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",ronsf@wam.umd.edu; foerster@psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,63,195,198,4,45,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

In Experiment 1, participants who succeeded in maintaining the contraction during the entire task evaluated the targets to be less famous than did judges who did not succeed or were not required to engage in any facial contraction. In the second experiment, participants' success at their muscle contraction was monitored by electromyograph (EMG)feedback and a control group had to activate a different (frontalis) facial muscle.

Emotion regulation has many similarities to other regulatory tasks such as dieting, and abstaining from smoking, drugs, alcohol, ill-advised sexual encounters, gambling, and procrastination, but it differs in a few important respects. Emotion regulation is similar to other kinds of self-regulation in that it consists of three components. standards, monitoring, and strength. Emotion regulation involves overriding one set responses with another, incompatible set, just like with other types of self-control. And like other regulatory tasks, emotion regulation can fail either because of underregulation or because of misregulation. Although emotion regulation is similar in many respects to other regulatory tasks, it is a special case of self-regulation in that it can often undermine attempts at other kinds of self-control. Specifically, focusing on regulating moods and feeling stares can lead to a failure of self-control in other areas.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Psychol, Cleveland, OH 44119 USA","Tice, DM (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Psychol, Cleveland, OH 44119 USA.",,,,,,,103,185,189,9,71,LAWRENCE ERLBAUM ASSOC INC,MAHWAH,"10 INDUSTRIAL AVE, MAHWAH, NJ 07430-2262 USA",1047-840X,,,PSYCHOL INQ,Psychol.

A specific impairment in the ability to smile may elevate the risk for depression, with patients experiencing a reduced physiological feedback associated with smiling as well as the social consequences of the inability to communicate positive emotion. We tested the hypothesis that specific impairments in the ability to smile increase the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with facial neuromuscular disorders. Twenty-nine consecutive patients (mean age, 50.2 years; SD, 17.0 years; range, 18-81 years) with a facial neuromuscular disorder, who volunteered and completed all of the assessment measures participated. Facial neuromuscular impairments were assessed using multiple measures of facial motility and dysfunction, and emotional functioning was assessed using self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and positive and negative affect. Severity of global facial impairment was statistically controlled in evaluating the association between specific impairment in smiling and the degree of depressive symptoms. Separate hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated the specific impairment of smiling contributed to the prediction of depression (R-2 = .41, df = 3,25, p = .00) and anxiety (R-2 = .35, df = 3,25, p = .00), controlling first for the contribution of global impairment and facial physical disability. The specific impairment of smiling did not contribute to the prediction of positive emotional experience. Specific impairment of smiling and physical disability, but not global impairment of facial motion, were key predictors of depression in patients with facial neuromuscular disorders. The results emphasize the need to assess and treat depression and anxiety in patients with a facial neuromuscular disorder.",,"VanSwearingen, JM (reprint author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Phys Therapy, 6035 Forbes Tower, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,,,,,45,53,54,1,5,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0364-216X,,,AESTHET PLAST SURG,Aesthet.

A corpus of self-reported upward affect=regulation strategies was collected using questionnaires, interviews, and group discussions, in conjunction with an examination of existing literature on related topics. A total of 162 distinct strategies were identified and a preliminary categorisation was developed by the investigators. We then conducted a card-sort task in which 24 participants produced separate classifications of the strategies. The similarity matrix arising from co-occurrence data was subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and the obtained typology provided independent support for our proposed distinctions between strategies implemented cognitively and behaviourally, between diversion and engagement strategies, and between active distraction and direct avoidance, and for specific lower-level groupings of strategies relating to venting, reappraisal, and seeking social support. Potential refinements and applications of the resulting classification system are considered.","Brunel Univ, Dept Human Sci, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Parkinson, B (reprint author), Brunel Univ, Dept Human Sci, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",,,"Totterdell, Peter/0000-0002-5335-2611; Parkinson, Brian/0000-0001-8065-5725",,,,46,195,205,1,63,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0269-9931,,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

Two further questions are addressed in the study reported in this paper. First, critics have speculated that the effects of peripheral feedback from expressive bodily movement may lead to generalized diffuse pleasant or unpleasant experiences, rather than the specific emotional feelings consistent with James' position. Second if the Jamesian account is correct, then the simultaneous combination of multiple, consistent solaces of expressive bodily feedback should result in greater magnitudes of emotional response than those caused by separate, individual sources. The results of the present study replicate those of the only other study (Duclos et al., 1989) which has demonstrated specific effects of expressive behaviors on corresponding emotional feelings. It was also possible to demonstrate, via correlational analyses, that those people who are responsive to their expressions tend to be responsive to their postures as well, since subjects in this study received manipulations of their facial expressions mid their bodily, postures. The results of this study also indicate that matching combinations of facial expressions and bodily postures result in more powerful feelings of the corresponding emotional feelings than do either expressions or postures alone.

Two experiments tested a functional explanation for this effect. The authors hypothesized that automatic evaluation results directly in behavioral predispositions toward the stimulus, such that positive evaluations produce immediate approach tendencies, and negative evaluations produce immediate avoidance tendencies. Participants responded to attitude object stimuli either by pushing or by pulling a lever. Consistent with the hypothesis, participants were faster to respond to negatively valenced stimuli when pushing the lever away (avoid) than when pulling it toward them (approach) but were faster to respond to positive stimuli by pulling than by pushing the lever. This pattern held even when evaluation of the stimuli was irrelevant to the participants' conscious task. The automatic classification of stimuli as either good or bad appears to have direct behavioral consequences.","NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA","Chen, M (reprint author), NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,43,750,763,4,103,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0146-1672,1552-7433,,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

In Study 2. the same procedures were used with matched groups of outpatient schizophrenic men, patients with depression, and nonpsychiatric controls. Schizophrenia patients showed the usual effects from their facial expressions of sadness. fear, happiness, and surprise, but only from their postures of anger, whereas patients with depression showed the same effects only from their expressions and postures of sadness, and normal controls only from their expressions and postures of anger.

This paper examines the considerations that led to such models, examines the models in depth, and argues for a new multiprocess model. In particular, the distinction between schematic and conceptual processing, a centrepiece of many previous models, is extremely difficult to examine methodologically. Instead, this paper examines the role of preattentive mechanisms in the genesis of emotional reactions. It is claimed that fear and anxiety, but no other emotions, can be generated solely by unconscious processing, and that two distinct preattentive modules account for this dissociation. A good deal of research suggests that judgements of valence can be made preattentively, and this paper argues that the urgency of the stimulus is coded as well. When an urgency module signals that the situation is threatening, fear and anxiety are generated unconsciously. This allows for rapid behavioural reactions in situations in which such immediate responding is adaptive.","Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Robinson, MD (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, 603 E Daniel St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",michael@s.psych.uinc.edu,,,,,,108,119,121,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-9931,1464-0600,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

The ACE model further assumes that emotions contain three elements: (a) A = arousal or physiological activity, (b) C = cognition, and (c) E = expression. In addition, the model can be considered along two dimensions that determine if an emotion is righteous, sinful, natural, or distorted.

On the basis of prior body feedback research (Cacioppo, Priester & Berntson, 1993) it could be shown that approach behavior (arm flexion) leads to more positive evaluations than avoidance behavior (arm extension). This effect was obtained for online judgments as well as memory based judgments. Additionally, in Experiment 1, the influence of arm position was more pronounced, when arm position and photograph shared the same valence (arm flexion and attractive photos and arm extension and unattractive photos), whereas no influence on evaluation was observed when the valence of arm position and photograph was unshared (arm flexion and unattractive photos and arm extension and attractive photos). However, in Experiment 2; these results could only be replicated for attractive portraits. whereas for unattractive portraits both arm flexion and arm extension led to lower ratings compared to a control group. The results are discussed within the framework of a proposed contingency model that in general predicts body feedback effects only in the case of compatibility between the valence of expression and information. Furthermore, in Experiment 2 some evidence was obtained that qualifies the effect as automatic, inasmuch as' increased distraction from evaluating the photographs bolstered the effect.","Univ Wurzburg, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Forster, J (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, Schermerhorn Hall, New York, NY 10027 USA.",foerster@psych.columbia.edu,,,,,,53,18,18,0,6,HOGREFE & HUBER PUBLISHERS,GOTTINGEN,"MERKELSTR 3, D-37085 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY",0949-3964,,,Z EXP PSYCHOL,Z.

Cooling enhances positive affect, whereas warming depresses it. Three studies assessed this hypothesised series of effects. Study 1 found that when subjects engaged facial muscles in a manner analogous to a negative emotional expression, the volume of ambient air inhaled through the nose decreased, forehead temperature (a measure of brain temperature) increased, and participants reported feeling more negative affect. Study 2 established that prevention of nasal breathing generated negative affect. Study 3 indicated that forehead temperature increased when nasal breathing was prevented, without forehead muscle movement. Further, facial movement and prevention of nasal inhalation had no effects on arm temperature, showing that facial movement has only locally specific temperature effects. The hypotheses generated from VTEE were thus generally supported, and suggest a means by which facial action can cause changes in affective state in the absence of cognitive appraisal.","STANFORD UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,STANFORD,CA 94305; UNIV PITTSBURGH,SCH DENT,PITTSBURGH,PA 15260; UNIV MICHIGAN,INST SOCIAL RES,ANN ARBOR,MI","McIntosh, DN (reprint author), UNIV DENVER,DEPT PSYCHOL,DENVER,CO 80208, USA.",,,,,,,33,23,23,0,5,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND BN3 2FA",0269-9931,,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

Other than the object-body (i.e. the body that a third person observer can know), which remains of interest both to the dominant tradition and to social constructionism's examination of how discourse constructs this object-body, neither the dominant nor the successor discourse deals with the inherently embodied character of all social practices, including discursive practices themselves.

In a third experiment, with a double-task procedure, it was shown that when encoding was accompanied by head movements that were compatible with words, participants were better at performing the secondary task than when words and head movements were incompatible. These findings suggest that performing incompatible motoric and conceptual tasks concurrently requires more cognitive capacity.

The current data support the following: Facial actions are sensitive to social context, yet correspond to the affective dimension of emotions; marches with specific emotions are unlikely. They modulate ongoing emotions, and initiate them. These two claims have received substantially improved support, in part due to studies controlling for effects of experimental demand and task difficulty. Facial action may influence the occurrence of specific emotions, not simply their valence and intensity. Facial action is not necessary for emotions.

Subjects who were instructed to inhibit their mirth smiled and laughed less often than control subjects, but their ratings of the monologue's funniness were similar to those of control subjects. Subjects who were told that the laboratory setting inhibited mirth smiled and laughed the same as control subjects, but they rated the monologue as funnier than did control subjects (an augmentation effect).","NORTHWESTERN UNIV,EVANSTON,IL 60208","OLSON, JM (reprint author), UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO,DEPT PSYCHOL,LONDON,ON N6A 5C2,CANADA.",,,,,,,23,16,16,0,5,SAGE PUBL INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320",0146-1672,,,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

Since Darwin's time, researchers have documented that emotional experience is shaped by both facial and postural feedback. Two experiments were conducted to determine whether emotional experience and facial expression are influenced by vocal feedback as well. In Experiment I, subjects were asked to read a joyous, loving, sad, or angry script. The impact on emotional experience and expression was assessed in two ways: (a) Subjects completed a self-report measure of emotion, and (b) judges rated subjects' faces as they read the scripts. In Experiment 2, subjects were required to try to reproduce a ''random'' sound pattern vocally. These tones were designed to mimic the voice quality, rhythm, intonation, and pausing associated with joy, love, sadness, anger, or fear, or, in the control condition, with an emotionally neutral state. The impact on subjects' subjective emotional experience was assessed by a self-report questionnaire. As predicted in both experiments, emotional experience and/or facial expression were affected by verbal and/or vocal feedback (Experiment 1) and by vocal feedback alone (Experiment 2). Possible explanations for these results are discussed.","UNIV CHICAGO, GRAD SCH BUSINESS, CHICAGO, IL 60637 USA","HATFIELD, E (reprint author), UNIV HAWAII, DEPT PSYCHOL, 2430 CAMPUS RD, HONOLULU, HI 96822 USA.",,,,,,,67,35,36,1,13,SELECT PRESS,CORTE MADERA,"PO BOX 37, CORTE MADERA, CA 94976 USA",0886-1641,,,J SOC BEHAV PERS,J.

After an emotional prime, subjects were simultaneously exposed to target displays portraying two different negative emotions. Target emotions congruent with the primed emotion were judged as more intense. Emotive priming did not increase recognition for affectively congruent target displays that were actually presented, but priming effects appeared on recognition for displays not actually seen. Emotively congruent displays that had not been presented were falsely recognized, whereas emotively incongruent displays that had not been seen were correctly reported as not recognized. The results indicated that emotional congruence effects seemed to emerge from the increased probability that congruent behaviors were schematically processed whereas controlled attentional processing resources were reserved for emotively incongruent behaviors.","WAYNE STATE UNIV,DETROIT,MI 48202","HANSEN, CH (reprint author), OAKLAND UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,ROCHESTER,MI 48309, USA.",,,,,,,52,15,15,0,14,SAGE PUBL INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320",0146-1672,,,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

The AIM, based on a multiprocess approach to social judgments, identifies 4 alternative judgmental strategies: (a) direct access, (b) motivated, (c) heuristic, and (d) substantive processing. The model predicts that the degree of affect infusion into judgments varies along a processing continuum, such that judgments requiring heuristic or substantive processing are more likely to be infused by affect than are direct access or motivated judgments. The role of target, judge, and situational variables in recruiting high- or low-infusion judgmental strategies is considered, and empirical support for the model is reviewed.

In each experiment, individuals who had been induced to feel happy rendered more stereotypic judgments than did those in a neutral mood. Experiment 1 demonstrated this phenomenon with a mood induction procedure that involved recalling life experiences. Experiments 2 and 3 suggested that the greater reliance on stereotypes evident in the judgments of happy individuals was not attributable to cognitive capacity deficits created by intrusive happy thoughts or by cognitively disruptive excitement or energetic arousal that may accompany the experience of happiness. In Experiment 4, happy individuals again were found to render more stereotypic judgments, except under conditions in which they had been told that they would be held accountable for their judgments. These results suggest that although happy people's tendency to engage in stereotypic thinking may be pervasive, they are quite capable of avoiding the influence of stereotypes in their judgments when situational factors provide a motivational impetus for such effort.","INDIANA UNIV, DEPT SOCIAL & BEHAV SCI, BLOOMINGTON, IN 47401 USA; VANDERBILT UNIV, DEPT PSYCHOL, NASHVILLE, TN 37240 USA","BODENHAUSEN, GV (reprint author), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT PSYCHOL, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.",,,,,,,84,333,340,2,35,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

Previously, researchers have been critical of experiments designed to test this facial feedback hypothesis, particularly in terms of methodological problems that may lead to demand characteristics. In an effort to surmount these methodological problems Strack, Martin, and Stepper (1988) developed an experimental procedure whereby subjects were induced to contract facial muscles involved in the production of an emotional pattern, without being asked to actually simulate an emotion. Specifically, subjects were required to hold a pen in their teeth, which unobtrusively creates a contraction of the zygomaticus major muscles, the muscles involved in the production of a human smile. This manipulation minimises the likelihood that subjects are able to interpret their zygomaticus contractions as representing a particular emotion, thereby preventing subjects from determining the purpose of the experiment. Strack et al. (1988) found support for the facial feedback hypothesis applied to pleasant affect, in that subjects in the pen-in-teeth condition rated humorous cartoons as being funnier than subjects in the control condition (in which zygomaticus contractions were inhibited). The present study represents an extension of this nonobtrusive methodology to an investigation of the facial feedback of unpleasant affect. Consistent with the Strack et al. procedure, we wanted to have subjects furrow their brow without actually instructing them to do so and without asking them to produce any emotional facial pattern at all. This was achieved by attaching two golf tees to the subject's brow region (just) above the inside corner of each eye) and then instructing them to touch the tips of the golf tees together as part of a ""divided-attention"" experiment Touching the tips of the golf tees together could only be achieved by contraction of the corrugator supercilii muscles, the muscles involved in the production of a sad emotional facial pattern Subjects reported significantly more sadness in response to aversive photographs while touching the tips of the golf tees together than under conditions which inhibited corrugator contractions. These results provide evidence, using a new and unobtrusive manipulation, that facial feedback operates for unpleasant affect to a degree similar to that previously found for pleasant affect.","PURDUE UNIV,W LAFAYETTE,IN 47907","LARSEN, RJ (reprint author), UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT PSYCHOL,580 UNION DR,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109, USA.",,,,,,,41,86,88,4,33,PSYCHOLOGY PRESS,HOVE,"27 CHURCH RD, HOVE, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND BN3 2FA",0269-9931,,,COGNITION EMOTION,Cogn.

While reading the story, all subjects were induced to hold their faces in expressions of either happiness or anger In addition, one group of subjects engaged in 2 min of vigorous exercise immediately before reading the story. Another group engaged in the exercise 90 s before reading the story. The control group read the story without having exercised. Non-aroused subjects tended to report more favorable reactions when smiling than when holding an angry expression. This difference was significant when there was a delay between the exercise and the rating task and was reduced to nonsignificance when there was no delay.

A number of studies are discussed that are relevant to the authors' contention that a more promising approach to understanding the huge diversity among emotions is to think in terms of emotions being assemblages of basic components rather than combinations of other basic emotions. The authors stress that their position does not deny that emotions are based on ""hardwired"" biological systems. On the other hand, the existence of such systems does not mean that some emotions (such as those that appear on lists of basic emotions) have a special status. Finally, the authors note that Ekman, Izard, and Panksepp, in adopting different starting points for their research, arrive at rather different conclusions as to what basic emotions are and which emotions are basic. It is concluded that converging resolutions of these questions are improbable.","NORTHWESTERN UNIV,EVANSTON,IL 60201","TURNER, TJ (reprint author), UNIV KENTUCKY,DEPT PSYCHOL,KASTLE HALL,LEXINGTON,KY 40506, USA.",,,,,,,27,38,38,2,21,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242",0033-295X,,,PSYCHOL REV,Psychol.

Forty-six Minangkabau men were instructed to contract facial muscles into prototypical configurations of 5 emotions. In comparison with a group of 62 Ss from the United States, cross-cultural consistencies were found in (a) autonomic nervous system (ANS) differences between emotions and (b) high configuration quality being associated with increased ANS differentiation and increased report of emotional experience. These findings provide the first evidence that these patterns of emotion-specific ANS activity and the capacity of voluntary facial action to generate this activity are not unique to American culture.","UNIV CALIF SAN FRANCISCO,SAN FRANCISCO,CA 94143; UNIV S CAROLINA,COLUMBIA,SC 29208","LEVENSON, RW (reprint author), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT PSYCHOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720, USA.",,,,"NIA NIH HHS [AG07476]; NIMH NIH HHS [MH38691, MH39895]",,,57,171,175,1,36,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242",0022-3514,,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

During each trial subjects pressed a button to indicate when they had reached the required state, and the latency from emotion cue to button press was measured. Heart rate, skin conductance and EMG from four facial sites (brow, cheek, jaw and mouth) were recorded for 15 s before and after the button press and during a baseline period prior to each trial. Self-reports were obtained after each trial. Facial EMG and patterns of autonomic arousal differentiated among the four emotions within each task. Shorter self-generation latency in the Feel-and-Show versus the Feel condition indicated the facilitative effect of facial expression on the self-generation of emotion. Furthermore, the presence of autonomic changes and self-reported affect in the Show condition supports the sufficiency version of the facial feedback hypothesis. The self-generation method employed as an emotion elicitor was shown to reliably induce emotional reactions and is proposed as a useful technique for the elicitation of various emotional states in the laboratory.","DARTMOUTH COLL, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA","HESS, U (reprint author), UNIV GENEVA, DEPT PSYCHOL, 24 RUE GEN DUFOUR, CH-1211 GENEVA 4, SWITZERLAND.",,"Hess, Ursula/B-6736-2008; Kappas, Arvid/F-8224-2013","Hess, Ursula/0000-0002-6793-7282; Kappas, Arvid/0000-0002-7715-8709",,,,60,67,68,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8760,1872-7697,,INT J PSYCHOPHYSIOL,Int.

As a test of this logic, 60 women read 2 equally funny sets of jokes. A laugh track was played in their headphones for 1 of the 2 sets of jokes. Although the laugh track had no impact on Ss' mirth, Ss were told that it would facilitate, inhibit, or not affect smiling and laughter. As predicted, in a later free-time period when Ss could read the books from which the jokes came, Ss who were told the laugh track increased mirth spent most time reading the book whose jokes had not been accompanied by laughter (a discounting effect), whereas Ss who were told the laugh track decreased mirth spent most time reading the book whose jokes had been accompanied by laughter (an augmentation effect); Ss who were told the laugh track did not affect mirth read the 2 books equally.",,"OLSON, JM (reprint author), UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO,CTR SOCIAL SCI,DEPT PSYCHOL,LONDON N6A 5C2,ONTARIO,CANADA.",,,,,,,41,44,44,2,16,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242",0022-3514,,,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

First, I detail the criteria for establishing genetic and epigenetic contributions to facial behavior. Under these criteria, cross-cultural communality in canonical facial displays implies neither their genetic control nor their fundamental relation to emotion. New findings reestablish phylogenetic continuity by showing that human facial displays and vigilance for them, like their nonhuman counterparts, coevolve in the service of social motives; faces issued in solitude typically reflect imaginary or implicit interaction. Two evolutionary trends are probably involved in shaping facial actions - emancipation of reflexes, and automatization of instrumental acts. Modern conceptions of genetic and cultural evolution, and knowledge about animal signaling, suggest new hypotheses regarding the origins and functions of facial displays. In so doing, they clarify how facial displays relate to reflexion, motive and intention, emotion and psychophysiology, and language and paralanguage.",,"FRIDLUND, AJ (reprint author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT PSYCHOL, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.",,,,NCRR NIH HHS [2-S07-RR-07083-20],,,356,128,128,1,36,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0301-0511,1873-6246,,BIOL PSYCHOL,Biol.
