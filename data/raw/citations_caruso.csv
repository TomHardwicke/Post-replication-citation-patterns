Our study answers the call for a comprehensive meta-analysis examining the available evidence on money priming (Vadillo, Hardwicke, & Shanks, 2016). By conducting a systematic search of published and unpublished literature on money priming, we sought to achieve three key goals. First, we aimed to assess the presence of biases in the available published literature (e.g., publication bias). Second, in the case of such biases, we sought to derive a more accurate estimate of the effect size after correcting for these biases. Third, we aimed to investigate whether design factors such as prime type and study setting moderated the money priming effects. Our overall meta-analysis included 246 suitable experiments and showed a significant overall effect size estimate (Hedges' g = .31, 95% CI [0.26, 0.36]). However, publication bias and related biases are likely given the asymmetric funnel plots, Egger's test and two other tests for publication bias. Moderator analyses offered insight into the variation of the money priming effect, suggesting for various types of study designs whether the effect was present, absent, or biased. We found the largest money priming effect in lab studies investigating a behavioral dependent measure using a priming technique in which participants actively handled money. Future research should use sufficiently powerful preregistered studies to replicate these findings.","[Lodder, Paul; Wicherts, Jelte M.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Methodol & Stat, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Ong, How Hwee] Tilburg Univ, Dept Social Psychol, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Grasman, Raoul P.

Despite the popularity of CPro and CPer, we believe that using them may lead to an incorrect conclusion of (a) successful replication when the population effect sizes in the original and replicated studies are different; and (b) unsuccessful replication when the population effect sizes in the original and replicated studies are identical but their sample sizes are different. Our simulation results show that the performances of CPro and CPer become biased, such that researchers can easily make a wrong conclusion of successful/unsuccessful replication.

Thoughts of money also make people self-centered. We propose that reminding depleted individuals of money would in fact make them less self-centered and more other-oriented. We draw on evidence that money has potential to produce feelings of energy and that greater energy predicts more considerate behavior. We tested whether reminders (thoughts) of money reduce or counteract the selfish effects of depletion, promoting considerate responses. Design/Methodology/Approach Data were obtained through experiments conducted via the internet with working adult participants recruited in the USA and Hong Kong. Findings Depletion positively predicted self-centeredness, replicating previous research. As we hypothesized, thoughts of money (vs. money-neutral object) reduced or eliminated this effect. The mediating process was bolstered feelings of energy. Implications Organizational research has focused on showing how money in the form of compensation affects behavior. We provide a more nuanced understanding of the role of money in employee behavior. Reminders of money help employees feel energized in the face of depletion and in turn rein in selfish impulses. Our findings imply that when employees are drained, thoughts of money in general, even beyond the form of compensation, can provide strength to care about others besides the self.","[De Cremer, David] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England","De Cremer, D (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England.",aureliam@gmail.com; dd447@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,95,1,1,6,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0889-3268,1573-353X,,J BUS PSYCHOL,J.

This paper investigates teaching and learning about one of the most researched, applied and contested concepts in Environmental and Ecological Economics: Ecosystem Assessment and Valuation (ESAV). It presents students' conceptions on ESAV gained through group discussions. The transcripts were analyzed with the phenomenographic and documentary method. The analysis focuses both on the way students describe ecological, social and economic aspects, and on the criteria they use to make political and management decisions. The main results are that students tend to see nature as a place for recreation and wildlife, do not see knowledge as uncertain and hardly bring up the idea of an economic valuation. Based on students' conceptions, as well as research from Ecological and Environmental Economics and Economics Education, I suggest a curriculum for ESAV.","[Beer, David Loew] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Social Sci, Dept Econ, August Croisst Str 5, D-76829 Landau, Germany; [Beer, David Loew] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies eV, IASS Potsdam, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany","Beer, DL (reprint author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Social Sci, Dept Econ, August Croisst Str 5, D-76829 Landau, Germany.; Beer, DL (reprint author), Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies eV, IASS Potsdam, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany.",David.LoewBeer@iass-potsdam.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education through Hans-Bockler foundation,This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education through a PhD scholarship of the Hans-Bockler foundation.,,85,0,0,2,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

After primed with the communal mode and market mode, participants were instructed to decide whether or not give an advice (profitable or damnous) to a stranger without any feedback. The behavioral results showed that participants preferred to give the profitable advice to the stranger more slowly compared with the damnous advice, but this difference was only observed in the market mode condition. The ERP results indicated that participants demonstrated more negative N1 amplitude for the damnous advice compared with the profitable advice, and larger P300 was elicited in the market mode relative to both the communal mode and the control group. More importantly, participants in the market mode demonstrated larger P300 for the profitable advice than the damnous advice, whereas this difference was not observed at the communal mode and the control group. These findings are consistent with the dual-process system during decision-making and suggest that market mode may lead to deliberate calculation for costs and benefits when giving the profitable advice to others.","[Li, Jin; Zhan, Youlong; Fan, Wei; Li, Mei; Sun, Yu; Zhong, Yiping] Hunan Normal Univ, Dept Psychol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Li, Jin; Zhan, Youlong; Fan, Wei; Li, Mei; Sun, Yu; Zhong, Yiping] Cognit & Human Behav Key Lab Hunan Prov, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lei] Liaoning Normal Univ, Res Ctr Brain & Cognit Neurosci, Dalian, Peoples R China","Zhong, YP (reprint author), Hunan Normal Univ, Dept Psychol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.; Zhong, YP (reprint author), Cognit & Human Behav Key Lab Hunan Prov, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",ypzhong@hunnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31671134, 31500883]; major project of National Social Science Foundation of China [17ZDA326]; Humanities and Social Science Research Planning Fund Project of Chinese Ministry of Education [13YJA190001]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2015JJ2101]; Hunan Provincial Innovation Foundation For Postgraduate [CX2017B162]","This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31671134, 31500883), the major project of National Social Science Foundation of China (17ZDA326), the Humanities and Social Science Research Planning Fund Project of Chinese Ministry of Education (13YJA190001), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (2015JJ2101), and Hunan Provincial Innovation Foundation For Postgraduate (CX2017B162).",,67,0,0,0,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

The adoption of strong progressive redistributive policies is crucial to reducing class inequities, yet many barriers to doing so exist. This review examines class-based policy preferences, focusing on the effects of economic self-interest, system justification, and classist, racist, and sexist stereotypes on policy support. The impact of broader economic conditions is also considered. Collectively, this body of research makes clear that building stronger cross-class support for redistributive policies and programs will prove difficult without addressing both class-based power differences and beliefs that justify inequality. Reducing stereotypes and developing a shared sense of societal responsibility that cuts across class lines can help advance these goals.

Prior research has shown that making monetary value salient fosters self-interested behavior in experimental settings (Vohs, Mead, and Goode, 2006), reduces the intrinsic value ascribed to pro-social activities such as volunteering (Pfeffer and DeVoe, 2009), and reduces the efficacy of environmentally relevant interventions (Steinhorst, Klockner, and Matthies, 2015). These findings raise concern that ecosystem service Valuation information might adversely impact individual's pro-environmental behaviors. This study uses an experimental framework to determine whether ordinary citizens' exposure to valuation information, such as one might encounter in a news article or fundraising materials, might influence an individual's contribution to a natural resource conservation fund. The study is implemented with 250 participants from across the United States. We find that participants who receive a ""natural resource description plus valuation"" treatment donate a statistically significant lower dollar amount of their experimental earnings on average than those who read the narrative alone. Based upon this evidence, we assert that ecosystem service valuation information has the potential to negatively impact financial support for the exact resources the information is designed to promote.

We offer a systematic approach to addressing this challenge and implement it in the domain of money priming. In three preregistered experiments (N = 4,649), participants were exposed to one of a number of money manipulations before completing self-report measures of money activation (Study 1); engaging in a behavioral-persistence task (Study 3); completing self-report measures of subjective wealth, self-sufficiency, and communion-agency (Studies 1-3); and completing demographic questions (Studies 1-3). Four of the five manipulations we tested activated the concept of money, but, contrary to what we expected based on the preponderance of the published literature, no manipulation consistently affected any dependent measure. Moderation by sociodemographic characteristics was sparse and inconsistent across studies. We discuss implications for theories of money priming and explain how our approach can complement recent efforts to build a reproducible, cumulative psychological science.","[Caruso, Eugene M.; Landy, Justin F.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Shapira, Oren] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Caruso, EM (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 South Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",ecaruso@chicagobooth.edu,,,University of Chicago Booth School of Business; John Templeton Foundation,This work was supported by The University of Chicago Booth School of Business and by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation.

Conceptualizing individual privileged identities in this way means that privileged identities may exist alongside marginalized intersectional identities. However, in this article, the author defines privilege as a multi-identity act that is facilitated and supported by institutions and organizations (e.g., banks, law enforcement, and schools). These institutions are defined as power-governors that regulate access to scaffolds of privilege afforded to the affluent and wealthy. The author posits that power-governors were created to support an ideology of White supremacy and to organize actors within the system to perpetuate and legitimize the status quo. The author describes the ways in which White wealthy men use privilege as a means to access and gain power while White men in lower-and working-classes use privilege to build relationships and legitimize inequality. The author also discusses the proxy privilege of White women and people of color and how this privilege is in fact restricted to specific physical spaces and is limited due to their overt marginalized identities.

Do they differ in their responses to unfair treatment? For example, are the wealthy more or less likely to accept an unfair offer in an ultimatum game where it is costly to reject an unfair offer? How about when it is not costly to reject an unfair offer? In the present research, we measured self-reported wealth (i.e., family income, Studies 1-3) and manipulated wealth using a ""lucky draw"" game (Studies 2 and 3) to examine how wealth affects responses to unfairness in an ultimatum game (Studies 1-3) and a new game called the cost-free rejection game (CFRG, Study 3). Across three studies, we found that wealthy people rejected an unfair offer (i.e., being offered 20% while the other kept 80% of the endowment) more frequently than the less wealthy, and that this tendency to reject unfairness was mediated by their increased feelings of entitlement. This suggests that the wealthy, or even people who temporarily perceive themselves to be wealthy, are more easily offended by unfairness than the less wealthy.","[Ding, Yi; Chen, Xu] Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Tiansheng Rd 2, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Ding, Yi; Ji, Tingting; Van Lange, Paul A.

This article will summarize research in sustainability literature that indicates that sustainability requires a constant human population, as well as ecologically benign method of production. This article will survey a number of helpful frameworks that address the key obstacles to sustainability, namely population growth, and unsustainable production and consumption. These frameworks are discussed in the context of business-level solutions and production systems.

However, research that investigates money priming in an advertising context is scarce. This article presents two empirical studies examining consumer reactions after being primed with money and exposed to advertisements presenting either conspicuous or non-conspicuous products. Consumer reactions were investigated with respect to their attitude towards the ad, product evaluation and signalling needs. The findings indicate that the evaluation of a conspicuous product, and the respective ad promoting it, benefit from money priming while the evaluation of a non-conspicuous product is not affected. Moreover, money priming elicits signalling needs in situations where consumers are confronted with conspicuous products. Our moderated mediation models show that these signalling needs mediate the positive effects of money priming in conspicuous situations.","[Huettl-Maack, Verena; Gatter, M.

I confront one of the most influential ones, the constitutive explanations or mechanism approach, with methodological claims that directly relate the economic model of choice with neuronal embodiments, represented by Glimcher's influential work. Constitutive explanations are composite and non-reductionist, therefore allow for recognizing complex causal interactions between basal neuronal phenomena and cognitive structures, also involving external symbolic media. I demonstrate the power of this methodology in discussing the example of money, which Glimcher posits as one of the most important research tasks in further developing neuroeconomics. Whereas Glimcher justifies neuroscientific reductionism by presenting an evolutionary rationale for deploying formal economic models on particular modules enabling choice, the case of money reveals the need for mechanistic explanations that include a substantial role for cultural evolution, though recognizing causal interactions with basal neuronal mechanisms.","[Herrmann-Pillath, Carsten] Univ Witten Herdecke, Dept Econ & Management, Witten, Germany; [Herrmann-Pillath, Carsten] Erfurt Univ, Max Weber Ctr Adv Social & Cultural Studies, Erfurt, Germany","Herrmann-Pillath, C (reprint author), Univ Witten Herdecke, Dept Econ & Management, Witten, Germany.; Herrmann-Pillath, C (reprint author), Erfurt Univ, Max Weber Ctr Adv Social & Cultural Studies, Erfurt, Germany.",cahepil@online.de,,"Herrmann-Pillath, Carsten/0000-0001-6078-0078",,,,86,0,0,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

Dubos (1901-1982) conducted groundbreaking studies concerning early-life environmental exposures (e.g., diet, social interactions, commensal microbiota, housing conditions) and adult disease. However, Dubos looked beyond the scientific focus on disease, arguing that ""mere survival is not enough"". He defined mental health as fulfilling human potential, and expressed concerns about urbanization occurring in tandem with disappearing access to natural environments (and elements found within them); thus modernity could interfere with health via ""missing exposures"". With the advantage of emerging research involving green space, the microbiome, biodiversity and positive psychology, we discuss ecological justice in the dysbiosphere and the forces-financial inequity, voids in public policy, marketing and otherwise-that interfere with the fundamental rights of children to thrive in a healthy urban ecosystem and learn respect for the natural environment. We emphasize health within the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) rubric and suggest that greater focus on positive exposures might uncover mechanisms of resiliency that contribute to maximizing human potential. We will entrain our perspective to socioeconomic disadvantage in developed nations and what we have described as ""grey space""; this is a mental as much as a physical environment, a space that serves to insidiously reinforce unhealthy behavior, compromise positive psychological outlook and, ultimately, trans-generational health.

This is surprising given that consumption cues are increasingly present in nontraditional consumer contexts, such as healthcare, education, and politics. This research develops a measure of two types of consumer regulation strategies, cue-based and budget-based (studies 1-4), and demonstrates that these strategies influence how people respond to consumption cues in a political context (study 5). Specifically, in a study involving the 2012 American Presidential Election, priming survey participants as consumers (versus citizens) influenced both voting intentions and self-reported voting behavior, and the newly developed consumer regulation scale was instrumental in detecting this effect. These findings suggest there may be merit in the escalating debate and concern over referring to voters as consumers.

Vohs's (2015) response to the absence of money priming effects reported by Rohrer, Pashler, and Harris (2015) provides an example of this approach. Unfortunately, vote counting is a poor strategy to assess the reliability of psychological findings because it neglects the impact of selection bias and questionable research practices. In the present comment, we show that a range of meta-analytic tools indicate irregularities in the money priming literature discussed by Rohrer et al. and Vohs, which all point to the conclusion that these effects are distorted by selection bias, reporting biases, or p-hacking. This could help to explain why money-priming effects have proven unreliable in a number of direct replication attempts in which biases have been minimized through preregistration or transparent reporting. Our major conclusion is that the simple proportion of significant findings is a poor guide to the reliability of research and that preregistered replications are an essential means to assess the reliability of money-priming effects.","[Vadillo, Miguel A.] Kings Coll London, Primary Care & Publ Hlth Sci, Addison House,Guys Campus, London SE1 1UL, England; [Hardwicke, Tom E.; Shanks, David R.] UCL, Div Psychol & Language Sci, London, England","Vadillo, MA (reprint author), Kings Coll London, Primary Care & Publ Hlth Sci, Addison House,Guys Campus, London SE1 1UL, England.",miguel.vadillo@kcl.ac.uk,"Shanks, David/A-1510-2015; Vadillo, Miguel/A-8702-2011","Shanks, David/0000-0002-4600-6323; Vadillo, Miguel/0000-0001-8421-816X; Hardwicke, Tom/0000-0001-9485-4952",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J500185/1],"We are indebted to Doug Rohrer, Kathleen Vohs, and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers for their valuable comments on earlier versions of this article.

These findings were backed up by a small-scale meta-analysis across our entire data (N = 365). Hence, we also included a third study into the meta-analysis, in which the manipulation check indicated that the mental activation of money was comparably weak. This research offers new insights into the psychological mechanisms of money primes and reveals that interindividual differences, such as whether one feels privileged or not, can moderate the effects of money primes.","[Schuler, Johannes; Waenke, Michaela] Univ Mannheim, Dept Psychol, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany","Schuler, J (reprint author), Univ Mannheim, Parkring 47,Room 310, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",johannes.schuler@uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,47,7,7,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1948-5506,1948-5514,,SOC PSYCHOL PERS SCI,Soc.

Previous research has demonstrated that children react to money in similar ways to adults. The priming of young children with money related concepts or images has negatively affected their social behavior and social preferences, leading them to make more individualist and less pro-social choices and be less willing to help others. The aim of this research was to investigate the positive influence of money activation on children's behavior. The participants were 6-8 year old children who do not yet fully understand the instrumental function of money due to their young age. Two experimental studies were performed, the first of which analyzed the effect of perseverance and performance on a challenging task and the second investigated preferences with respect to delaying gratification. Sixty-one children aged 6 took part in the first study and forty-six scout camp participants 6-8 years of age were involved in the second experiment. The results support the hypotheses concerning the effects of money activation stating that (1) money activation influences children's perseverance and effectiveness in difficult individual tasks, and that (2) it increases children's preferences for delayed gratification. These results suggest that money has a symbolic power which may exert both positive and negative effects on children's behavior. Since children between the ages of 6 and 8 do not understand the instrumental function of money fully, certain symbolic meanings of money may have been responsible for the money priming effects. The findings suggest that the symbolic function of money is more primal than its instrumental function and that it probably develops at an earlier stage in life.","[Trzcinska, Agata; Sekscinska, Katarzyna] Univ Warsaw, Fac Psychol, Warsaw, Poland; [Trzcinska, Agata; Sekscinska, Katarzyna] Univ Warsaw, Inst Social Sci, Warsaw, Poland","Trzcinska, A (reprint author), Univ Warsaw, Fac Psychol, Warsaw, Poland.; Trzcinska, A (reprint author), Univ Warsaw, Inst Social Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",atrzcinska@psych.uw.edu.pl,,,Polish National Science Centre (NCN) [DEC-2013/11/B/HS6/01163],"This publication was supported by the Polish National Science Centre (NCN), grant no.

Study 3 furthermore showed that this effect occurs by reinforcing organizational identification. Our research identifies a factor that is already present in the work setting that could buffer the negative psychological and behavioural outcomes associated with ostracism: cues of money.

Yet, in most settings it is difficult to distinguish the effects of affluence on partisanship from those of closely related variables such as education. To address these concerns I use state lottery and administrative records to examine the effect of changing economic circumstances on the partisanship of over 1,900 registered voters. Winning larger amounts in the lottery produces a small increase in the probability an individual is later a registered Republican, an effect that is larger for those who registered to vote after winning. This suggests that wealth does affect partisanship, particularly for those without preexisting attachments to a political party. Comparing estimates from the lottery to cross-sectional data suggests the latter exaggerates the relationship between wealth and partisanship, although controlling for additional variables produces largely similar estimates.","[Peterson, Erik] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Peterson, E (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",erik.peterson@stanford.edu,,,National Science Foundation [DGE-114747],"The author thanks Morris Fiorina, Justin Grimmer, Simon Jackman, Neil Malhotra, Erin Gough, Jonathan Mummolo, Tor Peterson, Gabor Simonovits, Brad Spahn and attendees of the Stanford American Politics Workshop and Stanford Graduate Political Economy workshop for helpful comments.

Yet studies of human decision-making typically involve money, whereas nonhuman studies involve food. We therefore examined how context shifts human risk preferences to illuminate the evolution of decision-making. First, we assessed peoples' risk preferences across food, prizes, and money in a task where individuals received real rewards and learned about payoffs through experience. We found that people were relatively more risk-seeking for both food and prizes compared to money-indicating that people may treat abstract reward markers differently from concrete rewards. Second, we compared human risk preferences for food with that of our closest phylogenetic relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus), in order to illuminate the evolutionary origins of human decision-making strategies. In fact, human and chimpanzees were both relatively more risk-seeking compared to bonobos. Finally, we investigated why people respond differently to money versus concrete rewards when making decisions. We found that people were more risk-prone when making decisions about money that was constrained as a store of value, compared to money that could be freely exchanged. This shows that people are sensitive to money's usefulness as a store of value that can be used to acquire other types of rewards. Our results indicate that humans exhibit different preferences when making risky decisions about money versus food, an important consideration for comparative research. Furthermore, different psychological processes may underpin decisions about abstract rewards compared to concrete rewards. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Individuals were recruited from an undergraduate participant pool and MTurk. Meta-analytic results across the two samples revealed that money priming did not have a significant impact on willingness to act sustainably, but it did cause participants to distribute points less prosocially and report lower social connectedness than individuals in the control condition.

Moreover, it has further asserted its dominance over geopolitical discourse and ideology worldwide. I contend that neoliberal supremacy in the policy arena and upon domestic and international institutions has been largely uncontested because it has penetrated all aspects of life to the extent that it now represents what Thorstein Veblen referred to as ""the modern point of view."" Understanding the global power of neoliberalism requires examining not only its well-established hegemony over institutions as social constructs, but also its impact on habits of thought as mental constructs. From a Veblenian perspective, I argue that the neoliberal doctrine generates habits of thought which legitimize the transformation of a market-oriented economy into a full-fledged market society. The impact of the normalization of the neoliberal mode of behavior may, in the end, worsen the fracture between nation and state and unravel the fabric of society by justifying fully detached, emotion-free, and self-centered actions that crowd-out pro-social behaviors and challenge any social conception of the common good.","[Duroy, Quentin] Denison Univ, Econ, Granville, OH 43023 USA","Duroy, Q (reprint author), Denison Univ, Econ, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",,,,,,,21,3,3,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

These aims are a fundamental aspect of the human value/goal system, standing in relative conflict with aims concerning the well-being of others, as well as one's own personal and spiritual growth. Substantial evidence shows that people who place a relatively high priority on materialistic values/goals consume more products and incur more debt, have lower-quality interpersonal relationships, act in more ecologically destructive ways, have adverse work and educational motivation, and report lower personal and physical well-being. Experimentally activating materialistic aims causes similar outcomes. Given these ills, researchers have investigated means of decreasing people's materialism. Successful interventions encourage intrinsic/self-transcendent values/goals, increase felt personal security, and/or block materialistic messages from the environment.

Often the valuation is implicit, even mysterious. But in patches of the federal administrative state, paperwork burdens are quantified in hours and often monetized. When agencies do monetize, they look to how the labor market values the time of the people faced with paperwork. The result is that some people's time is valued over ten times more than other people's time. In contrast, when agencies monetize the value of statistical life for cost-benefit analysis, they look to how people faced with a risk of death subjectively value its reduction. In practice, agencies assign the same value to every statistical life saved by a given policy. This Article establishes these patterns of agency behavior and suggests that there is no satisfying justification for them. Welfarist and egalitarian principles, along with the logic of statistical life valuation, lean against the use of market wages to monetize a person's time doing government paperwork. The impact of this practice might be limited, given the modest ambition of today's paperwork reduction efforts. But time-related burdens-and benefits-are key consequences of government decisions in countless contexts. If we want to scale up a thoughtful process for valuing people's time in the future, we will need new foundations.","[Samaha, Adam M.] NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA","Samaha, AM (reprint author), NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,Filomen D'Agostino and Max E.

We address this knowledge gap through an audit study in academia of over 6,500 professors at top U. S. universities drawn from 89 disciplines and 259 institutions. In our experiment, professors were contacted by fictional prospective students seeking to discuss research opportunities prior to applying to a doctoral program. Names of students were randomly assigned to signal gender and race (White, Black, Hispanic, Indian, Chinese), but messages were otherwise identical. We hypothesized that discrimination would appear at the informal ""pathway"" preceding entry to academia and would vary by discipline and university as a function of faculty representation and pay. We found that when considering requests from prospective students seeking mentoring in the future, faculty were significantly more responsive to White males than to all other categories of students, collectively, particularly in higher-paying disciplines and private institutions. Counterintuitively, the representation of women and minorities and discrimination were uncorrelated, a finding that suggests greater representation cannot be assumed to reduce discrimination. This research highlights the importance of studying decisions made before formal entry points into organizations and reveals that discrimination is not evenly distributed within and between organizations.","[Milkman, Katherine L.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Operat Informat & Decis, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Akinola, Modupe] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, Dept Management, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Chugh, Dolly] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Management & Org, New York, NY 10003 USA","Milkman, KL (reprint author), 566 Jon M Huntsman Hall,3730 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",kmilkman@wharton.upenn.edu,,,Russell Sage Foundation; Wharton Dean's Research Fund,"We thank Professors Max Bazerman, Eric Bradlow, Joel Brockner, Gerard Cachon, Eugene Caruso, Emilio Castilla, Roberto Fernandez, Adam Galinsky, Jack Hershey, Raymond Horton, Stephan Meier, Ruth Milkman, Amanda Pallais, Lakshmi Ramarajan, and Zur Shapira for feedback on this article.

This article indirectly evaluates MBIs for essential ecosystem services by examining market allocation of another essential resource that is allocated by markets and which has experienced dramatic price increases: food. In an unequal world, markets respond to price increases by reducing food allocations to the destitute and malnourished, but not for the affluent. MBIs would increase the prices of ecosystem services and the commodities whose production degrades them, forcing the impoverished to reduce consumption by more than the wealthy. Furthermore, most MBIs would be prone to speculation and price instability, be incompatible with the satisfaction of individual preferences, or would not maximize economic surplus. Most environmental problems can be characterized as prisoner's dilemmas, which are best solved through cooperation, not competition. Society must create economic institutions that promote cooperation and ensure that the burdens of reducing throughput are not borne disproportionately by the poor. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In 1 set of studies published in this journal, Caruso, Vohs, Baxter, and Waytz (2013) found that incidental exposures to money led subjects to indicate greater support for inequality, socioeconomic differences, group-based discrimination, and free market economies. We conducted high-powered replication attempts of these 4 money priming effects and found no evidence of priming (weighted Cohen's d = 0.03). We later learned that Caruso et al. also found several null effects in their line of research that were not reported in the original article. In addition, the money priming effect observed in the first study of Caruso et al. was included in the Many Labs Replication Project (Klein et al., 2014), and only 1 of the 36 labs was able to find the effect.","[Rohrer, Doug] Univ S Florida, Dept Psychol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Pashler, Harold; Harris, Christine R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA","Rohrer, D (reprint author), Univ S Florida, Psychol PCD4118G, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",drohrer@usf.edu,,,"Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education [R305A110517]; James S.

Hence, the authors predicted that money primes would boost system justification, social dominance, belief in a just world, and free market ideology, and found supportive evidence. Rohrer, Pashler, and Harris (2015) failed to replicate those effects. This article discusses the factors that predict priming effects, and particularly those pertinent to differences between Caruso et al. and Rohrer et al. Variations in a prime's meaning, the ease with which primed content comes to mind, the prime's motivational importance, and the ambiguity of the outcome situation influence the impact of the prime. Money priming experiments (totaling 165 to date, from 18 countries) point to at least 2 major effects. First, compared to neutral primes, people reminded of money are less interpersonally attuned. They are not prosocial, caring, or warm. They eschew interdependence. Second, people reminded of money shift into professional, business, and work mentality. They exert effort on challenging tasks, demonstrate good performance, and feel efficacious. Money priming is not the same as priming another popular means of exchange, credit cards, and can have bigger effects when there is an implied connection between the self and having money. The practical benefits of money have been studied by other disciplines for decades, and the time is now for psychologists to study the effects of merely being reminded of money.","[Vohs, Kathleen D.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Vohs, KD (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Mkt, Carlson Sch Management 3 150, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",vohsx005@umn.edu,,,,,,68,39,39,3,69,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0096-3445,1939-2222,,J EXP PSYCHOL GEN,J.

Thinking about money increases individuals' disposition to perceive themselves in a business-like relationship with others in which transactions are based on objective criteria and the expression of emotion is considered inappropriate. Therefore, these individuals express less emotion in public and expect others to do likewise. Six experiments show that subtle reminders of money lead people to have more negative attitudes toward expressing emotions in public and to avoid expressing emotion in their written communications. In addition, money-primed participants judge others' emotions to be more extreme and are disposed to avoid interacting with persons who display these emotions, especially when participants believe that these emotions are expressed in public.

A question therefore arises over how such change impacts law's treatment of scientific evidence. The present standard for the admissibility of scientific evidence in federal courts in the U.S. asks judges to play the role of gatekeeper, determining if the proffered evidence conforms with several indicia of scientific validity. The replicability crisis, however, has demonstrated that these indicia frequently fail to adequately capture, or have lagged behind, science's best practices. Therefore, this article suggests that as much as the replicability crisis highlights serious issues in the scientific process, it should have similar implications and actionable consequences for legal practitioners and academics. The Article concludes with some suggestions to help ensure that legal decisions are influenced by the best science has to offer.","Univ Toronto, Fac Law, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada","Chin, JM (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Fac Law, 84 Queens Pk, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",jason.chin@mail.utoronto.ca,,"Chin, Jason/0000-0002-6573-2670",,,,96,7,8,0,13,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1076-8971,1939-1528,,PSYCHOL PUBLIC POL L,Psychol.

In this review, we analyze system legitimation and delegitimation in post-Communist societies from a social psychological perspective. We draw on system justification theory, which seeks to understand how, when and why people do (and do not) defend, bolster and justify existing social systems. We review some of the major tenets and findings of the theory and compare research on system-justifying beliefs and ideologies in traditionally Capitalist and post-Communist countries to determine: (1) whether there are robust differences in the degree of system justification in post-Communist and Capitalist societies, and (2) the extent to which hypotheses derived from system justification theory receive support in the post-Communist context. To this end, we summarize research findings from over 20 countries and cite previously unpublished data from a public opinion survey conducted in Poland. Our analysis confirms that there are lower levels of system justification in post-Communist countries. At the same time, we find that system justification possesses similar social and psychological antecedents, manifestations and consequences in the two types of societies. We offer potential explanations for these somewhat complicated patterns of results and conclude by addressing implications for theory and research on system justification and system change (or transition).","[Cichocka, Aleksandra] Univ Warsaw, Fac Psychol, Warsaw, Poland; [Cichocka, Aleksandra] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England; [Jost, John T.] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA","Cichocka, A (reprint author), Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Psychol, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",a.k.cichocka@kent.ac.uk,,,,,,178,24,25,1,18,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0020-7594,1464-066X,,INT J PSYCHOL,Int.

We encourage researchers to get into the habit of including multiple versions of the content (e.g., stimuli or vignettes) in their designs, to increase confidence in cross-stimulus generalization and to yield more realistic estimates of effect size.

In two studies conducted in field settings, the helping behavior of participants was observed. Passersby that just handled or not money at an automated teller machine were asked to participate in a short survey (Study 1) or have the opportunity to warn a female-confederate walking ahead of him/her that she dropped something on the ground (Study 2). In both studies, it was found that handling money several seconds earlier was associated with a decrease in helping behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
