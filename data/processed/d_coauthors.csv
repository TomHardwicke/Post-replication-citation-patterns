The current knowledge on non-sexual, subclinical forms of sadistic pleasure is poor. The present study therefore focussed on the personality correlates of sadistic pleasure and investigated the relationship between the different subcomponents of psychopathy and both dispositional and state-level sadistic pleasure. Method: N = 120 males drawn from a community sample filled out questionnaires to assess their level of psychopathy and dispositional sadism. Then, participants engaged in a bug-grinder procedure in which they were led to believe that they were killing pill bugs. The positive affect they reported after ostensibly killing the bugs served as measures of sadistic pleasure. The bug-grinding task was repeated a second time after installing either a positive victim attitude combined with giving human names to the bugs, or a negative victim attitude combined with labeling the bugs with numbers. Results: Although the Self-centred Impulsivity component of psychopathy had some relevance to sadism, it was the Coldheartedness subscale that showed the strongest relationship to sadistic pleasure. Specifically, increased Coldheartedness was uniquely related to more positive affect, along with less guilt after bug grinding. Limitations: Drawbacks of the study include the unique reliance on a male, community sample, and the potential impact of demand characteristics, including a suggestion that the participant put at least some bugs into the grinder. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the differential predictive value of psychopathy components for sadistic pleasure. Coldheartedness can be considered especially disturbing because of its unique relationship to harm-infliction of the most irreversible nature (i.e. killing), and gaining pleasure out of it.","[Lobbestael, Jill; van Teffelen, Martijn] Maastricht Univ, Fac Psychol & Neurosci, Dept Clin Psychol Sci, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1107 W Call St, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Lobbestael, J (corresponding author), Maastricht Univ, Fac Psychol & Neurosci, Dept Clin Psychol Sci, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",Jill.Lobbestael@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Lobbestael, Jill/0000-0001-9205-3115; van Teffelen, Martijn/0000-0003-2411-5323",Netherlands' Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [464-10-080]; German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [JA1785/3-1],"This work has been conducted in the program Open Research Area in the Social Sciences, funded by the Netherlands' Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) to A.A.

These effects were found whether helpers and recipients reflected on the same helping episode (Study 1) or different episodes (Studies 2 and 3).

Participants were randomly assigned to receive good or poor feedback on a practice trial of a cognitive test (Studies 1-3, 5-6) or their academic performance (Study 4). Those who received poor (vs. good) feedback predicted that they would feel less happy about a future top performance. However, when all participants received a top score on the actual test they became equally happy, regardless of initial feedback. That is, initial failure made people underestimate how good it would feel to succeed in the future. Inspired by Aesop's fable of the fox and the grapes, we term this phenomenon the sour-grape effect: A systematic tendency to downplay the value of unattainable goals and rewards. Mediation analyses suggest that the low happiness predictions were a self-protective maneuver, indicated by apparent denial of the personal and future relevance of their performance. Moderation analysis showed that people high in achievement motivation constituted the main exception, as they predicted (correctly) that a big improvement would bring them joy. In a final and high-powered experiment, the effect generalized from predicted happiness to predicted pride and gratitude. Crucially, the sour-grape effect was found repeatedly across two different countries (USA and Norway) and multiple settings (lab, field, online), including two pre-registered replications. In line with the principle of adaptive preferences from philosophy and cognitive dissonance theory from psychology, the results suggest that what people want is restricted by what they can get.","[Sjastad, Hallgeir] NHH, Ctr Appl Res, Bergen, Norway; [Sjastad, Hallgeir] Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Ent, Michael] Towson Univ, Towson, MD USA","Sjastad, H (corresponding author), Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway.; Sjastad, H (corresponding author), NHH, Ctr Appl Res, FAIR Insight Team, Bergen, Norway.",Hallgeir.Sjastad@snf.no,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Sjastad, Hallgeir/0000-0002-8730-1038",NA,NA,NA,62,1,1,5,10,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0022-1031,1096-0465,NA,J EXP SOC PSYCHOL,J.

Effortful thinking has been shown to help reduce anchoring effects, in which people form social judgments by adjusting from an initial value (the anchor). We therefore predicted that ego depletion would reduce the amount of adjustment from an initial anchor, leaving the final judgment relatively close to the anchor value. In contrast to previous research by Banker et al. (2017), we excluded alternative explanations, such as social mechanisms. In particular, we tested adjustment from internally generated and externally provided anchors. We theorized that judgment adjustment processes are the same for both internal and external cues. The results showed that neither self-generated nor experimenter-provided anchors were affected by ego depletion, thus leaving social mechanisms as the prime alternative explanation. The data also showed that susceptibility to anchoring is not a trait because reactions to different anchors were not substantially intercorrelated. Further, providing externally or internally generated anchors did not make a fundamental difference. However, the loss of data was higher with self-generated anchors. Overall, the results suggest that researchers can confidently rely on experimenter-generated anchors.","[Roeseler, Lukas; Starker, Ulrike] Harz Univ Appl Sci, Wernigerode, Germany; [Roeseler, Lukas; Schuetz, Astrid] Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Schutz, A (corresponding author), Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany.",astrid.schuetz@uni-bamberg.de,"Schutz, Astrid/U-4113-2018; Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Schutz, Astrid/0000-0002-6358-167X; Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Roseler, Lukas/0000-0002-6446-1901","state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany; University of Bamberg; University of QueenslandUniversity of Queensland","This research was funded by a graduate scholarship granted by the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany to Lukas Rdseler, by the University of Bamberg, and by the University of Queensland.

We discuss the implications of our findings for perceptions of corruption in general.","[Nezlek, John B.] SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Inst Psychol, Poznan, Poland; [Nezlek, John B.; Schug, Joanna] Coll William & Mary, Dept Psychol Sci, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA; [Newman, David B.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Schuetz, Astrid; Koydemir, Selda] Univ Bamberg, Dept Psychol, Bamberg, Germany; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Joshanloo, Mohsen] Keimyung Univ, Dept Psychol, Daegu, South Korea; [Lopes, Paulo N.] Catholic Univ Portugal, Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Alt, Nicholas P.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Cypryanska, Marzena] SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Dept Psychol, Warsaw, Poland; [Depietri, Marco] Univ Bamberg, Language Ctr, Bamberg, Germany; [Gorbaniuk, Oleg] John Paul II Catholic Univ Lublin, Inst Psychol, Lublin, Poland; [Huguet, Pascal] Blaise Pascal Univ, Natl Ctr Sci Res, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Kafetsios, Konstantinos] Univ Crete, Dept Psychol, Rethimnon, Greece; [Kuppens, Peter] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Res Unit Quantitat Psychol & Individual Differenc, Leuven, Belgium; [Park, Sanghee] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Psychol, Cheongju, South Korea; [San Martin, Alvaro] Univ Navarra, Dept Managing People Org, Pamplona, Spain; [Schaafsma, Juliette] Tilburg Univ, Dept Commun & Cognit, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Simunovic, Dora] Jacobs Univ, Bremen Int Grad Sch Social Sci, Bremen, Germany; [Yokota, Kunihiro] Grad Univ Adv Studies, Dept Evolutionary Studies Biosyst, Miura, Kanagawa, Japan","Nezlek, JB (corresponding author), SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Inst Psychol, Poznan, Poland.; Nezlek, JB (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Dept Psychol Sci, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",jbnezl@wm.edu,"Schutz, Astrid/U-4113-2018; Kafetsios, Konstantinos/F-1559-2011; Newman, David Benjamin/AAG-3632-2019; Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016; San Martin, Alvaro/S-8382-2019; Joshanloo, Mohsen/E-6357-2017","Schutz, Astrid/0000-0002-6358-167X; Kafetsios, Konstantinos/0000-0001-5933-4409; Newman, David Benjamin/0000-0002-1296-5817; Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Nezlek, John/0000-0003-4963-3637; Joshanloo, Mohsen/0000-0001-9350-6219; kuppens, peter/0000-0002-2363-2356; Schug, Joanna/0000-0003-1925-9496",NA,NA,NA,17,0,0,0,0,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,NA,NA,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,SEP 27,2019,14,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,e0222492,10.1371/journal.pone.0222492,NA,NA,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,LM6IT,WOS:000532353700012,31560694,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",NA,NA,2021-02-02,NA,baumeister

People with high trait self-control reported fewer such feelings and events than others. Poor sleep quality and interpersonal conflict were strong predictors of depleted feelings, and indeed the combination of very poor sleep and high interpersonal conflict led to a dramatic spike in reports of extremely depleted feelings. Depleted feelings were positively correlated with being young, female, politically non-extreme, and less well educated, and with finding life less meaningful, as well as with multitasking and hurrying. They increased across the day despite drops after meal times, thus attesting to the value of food and sleep. Pain and illness also raised them.

Results of five studies using various measures of indecisiveness (trait) and indecision (state), various operationalizations of free will beliefs (measured and manipulated), and various decision tasks provide support to the evolutionary hypothesis. Belief in free will is consistently associated with lower indecisiveness. However, one boundary condition of this effect is that it is limited to individuals with high self-concept clarity. These findings contribute to the literature on indecisiveness and advance our knowledge about the benefits of belief in free will for decision-making.","[Kokkoris, Michail D.] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kuehnen, Ulrich] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany","Kokkoris, MD (corresponding author), WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Mkt & Consumer Res, Dept Mkt, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",michail.kokkoris@wu.ac.at,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,87,0,0,4,12,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0749-5978,1095-9920,NA,ORGAN BEHAV HUM DEC,Organ.

The tendency to moralize the future more than the past was mediated by anticipating (one's own) emotional reactions and concern about one's reputation, which was stronger in the future as well. The findings fit the pragmatic view that people moralize the future partly to guide their choices and actions, such as by increasing their motivation to restrain selfish impulses and build long-term cooperative relationships with others.

Trait Psychological Entitlement was also measured as a potential moderator in all studies. In Study 1, participants wrote about a time they felt rejected, accepted, or something neutral. Compared to the control condition, social exclusion increased self-reported gratitude and observer-rated gratitude. These effects were found among people scoring low on narcissistic entitlement. For these participants also, social rejection increased perception of the benefactor's warmth, and this increase in perceived warmth mediated the increase in gratitude. Study 2 measured trait need to belong (rather than manipulating it via social rejection) and found similar results: participants low in trait entitlement and high in trait need to belong had higher levels of gratitude than those low in trait need to belong. In Study 3 some participants underwent a peer rejection manipulation. Upon receiving a gift, rejected participants low in entitlement were more grateful (according to self and observer ratings) and engaged in more prosocial behavior than nonrejected participants. The main conclusion is that, among people low in entitlement, social rejection stimulates a heightened desire for social connection, which moves them to functionally project warm intentions onto a benefactor, which in turn makes them more grateful.","[MacKenzie, Michael J.; Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [MacKenzie, Michael J.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1107 West Call St, Tallahassee, FL 32036 USA","MacKenzie, MJ (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; MacKenzie, MJ (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1107 West Call St, Tallahassee, FL 32036 USA.",mackenzie@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,89,2,2,6,28,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0146-7239,1573-6644,NA,MOTIV EMOTION,Motiv.

The question must be answered twice, given frequent confusion and conflation of self with self-concept. Summarizing and integrating themes from authenticity research as evident in this special issue, I draw these conclusions. True self-concepts are more plausible than genuinely true selves, if the latter are independent entities distinct from actual behavior and experience. Yet rather than a single true self-concept, people have multiple nonfalse ones, none of which is entirely true. Among these, the pragmatically most important is the desired reputation, given the social-cultural orientation of humankind. Desired reputation is more a guide and goal than a reality, but successes and failures at achieving that reputation will produce welcome and unwelcome feelings that are likely reported as feeling authentic and inauthentic (respectively). Understanding authenticity in this way solves some of the perennial problems that beset research and theory on authenticity, especially positive distortion and external rather than internal orientation.","[Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, McElwain Bldg,Level 4,Room 416, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, McElwain Bldg,Level 4,Room 416, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",r.baumeister@uq.edu.au,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,36,5,5,2,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1089-2680,1939-1552,NA,REV GEN PSYCHOL,Rev.

The present work provides one potential explanation for these discrepant findings: People are strongly motivated to preserve free will and moral responsibility, and thus do not have stable, logically rigorous notions of free will. Seven studies support this hypothesis by demonstrating that a variety of logically irrelevant (but motivationally relevant) features influence compatibilist judgments. In Study 1, participants who were asked to consider the possibility that our universe is deterministic were more compatibilist than those not asked to consider this possibility, suggesting that determinism poses a threat to moral responsibility, which increases compatibilist responding (thus reducing the threat). In Study 2, participants who considered concrete instances of moral behavior found compatibilist free will more sufficient for moral responsibility than participants who were asked about moral responsibility more generally. In Study 3a, the order in which participants read free will and determinism descriptions influenced their compatibilist judgments-and only when the descriptions had moral significance: Participants were more likely to report that determinism was compatible with free will than that free will was compatible with determinism. In Study 3b, participants who read the free will description first (the more compatibilist group) were particularly likely to confess that their beliefs in free will and moral responsibility and their disbelief in determinism influenced their conclusion. In Study 4, participants reduced their compatibilist beliefs after reading a passage that argued that moral responsibility could be preserved even in the absence of free will. Participants also reported that immaterial souls were compatible with scientific determinism, most strongly among immaterial soul believers (Study 5), and evaluated information about the capacities of primates in a biased manner favoring the existence of human free will (Study 6). These results suggest that people do not have one intuition about whether free will is compatible with determinism. Instead, people report that free will is compatible with determinism when desiring to uphold moral responsibility. Recommendations for future work are discussed.","[Clark, Cory J.] Univ Durham, Dept Psychol, Durham, England; [Winegard, Bo M.] Marietta Coll, Dept Psychol, Marietta, OH USA; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, St Lucia, Qld, Australia","Clark, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Psychol, Durham, England.",callcoryclark@gmail.com,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",Charles Koch Foundation,The work of CC was supported in part by a grant from The Charles Koch Foundation.,NA,80,4,4,2,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,NA,NA,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

The current body of scientific knowledge strongly indicates that conscious thought is a necessary condition for many human behaviors, and therefore, consciousness qualifies as a cause of those behaviors. We review illustrative experimental evidence for the causal power of conscious thought while also acknowledging its natural limitations. We argue that it is implausible that the metabolic costs inherent to conscious processes would have evolved in humans without any adaptive benefits. Moreover, we discuss the relevance of conscious thought to the issue of freedom. Many accounts hold conscious thought as necessary and conducive to naturalistic conceptions of personal freedom. Apart from these theories, we show that the conscious perception of freedom and the belief in free will provide sources of interesting findings, beneficial behavioral effects, and new avenues for research. We close by proposing our own challenge via outlining the gaps that have yet to be filled to establish hard evidence of an epiphenomenal model of consciousness. To be sure, we appreciate the epiphenomenalist challenge as it promotes critical thinking and inspires rigorous research. However, we see no merit in downplaying the causal significance of consciousness a priori. Instead, we believe it more worthwhile to focus on the complex interplay between conscious and other causal processes.","[Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, Fac Hlth & Behav Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Baumeister, Roy F.; Lau, Stephan; Maranges, Heather M.; Clark, Cory J.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Clark, Cory J.] Univ Durham, Dept Psychol, Durham, England","Lau, S (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",lau@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [LA 3891/1-1]; Charles Koch Foundation,"SL was supported by a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), number LA 3891/1-1.

However, the specific predictors and mechanisms of this form of female intrasexual competition are less well understood. We propose that one mechanism by which women harm rivals' social opportunities is through selectively transmitting reputation-relevant social information. Moreover, we contend that this behavior is designed to undermine the romantic and social appeal of same-sex romantic rivals who are perceived to be threatening. Evidence from five studies suggests that women's dissemination of social information is strategic and reliably predicted by various cues of romantic rival threat: attempts at mate poaching (Study 1), physical attractiveness (Studies 2 and 3), and provocative clothing (Studies 4 and 5). Women strategically harmed and failed to enhance the reputations of other women who threatened their romantic prospects directly (by flirting with their romantic partners) and indirectly (by being attractive or provocatively dressed). Women's dispositional levels of competitiveness also predicted their information transmission: highly competitive women (both generally and in romantic domains specifically) disclosed more reputation-damaging information than did less competitive women. Furthermore, women transmitted reputation-harming information about female targets independent of how much they explicitly liked those targets, suggesting a disconnect between women's intentions and their gossip behavior.

Studies 2a-2b distinguished the underlying motives for ascribing freedom to morally good and bad actions. Free will ascriptions for immoral actions were driven predominantly by affective responses (i.e., punitive desires, moral outrage, and perceived severity of the crime). Free will judgments for morally good actions were similarly driven by affective responses (i.e., reward desires, moral uplift, and perceived generosity), but also more pragmatic considerations (perceived utility of reward, counter-normativity of the action, and required willpower).

Across studies, people increased the magnitude of their moral judgments when an agent exceeded a descriptive norm and decreased the magnitude when an agent fell below a norm (Studies 1-4). Moreover, this differentiation was partially explained via perceptions of agents' desires (Studies 1-2); it emerged only when the agent was aware of the norm (Study 4); and it generalized to explain decisions of trust for real monetary stakes (Study 5).

Researchers have increasingly questioned the unilateral goodness of self-control and proposed that it is beneficial only up to a certain point, after which it becomes detrimental. The little empirical research on the issue shows mixed results. Hence, we tested whether a curvilinear relationship between self-control and subjective well-being exists. MethodWe used multiple metrics (questionnaires, behavioral ratings), sources (self-report, other-report), and methods (cross-sectional measurement, dayreconstruction method, experience sampling method) across six studies (N-total=5,318). ResultsWe found that self-control positively predicted subjective well-being (cognitive and affective), but there was little evidence for an inverted U-shaped curve. The results held after statistically controlling for demographics and other psychological confounds.

Against that view, we hypothesized that problems stem especially from unmet belongingness needs. To examine this, discrepancies between belongingness needs and relationship satisfaction were measured. MethodA total of 1,342 adolescents (M-age=13.94 years, 48.6% boys) completed questionnaires about belongingness needs, relationship satisfaction, loneliness, depressive symptoms, and self-esteem. A combination of polynomial regression analyses with response surface modeling examined the effects of both fulfilled and unmet belongingness needs on well-being. ResultsFulfilled belongingness needs did not affect adolescents' well-being. However, larger discrepancies between high belongingness needs and low relationship satisfaction were related to higher loneliness, more depressive symptoms, and lower self-esteem. Thus, well-being was most strongly affected among adolescents reporting an unmet need to belong. ConclusionsWe add to the current knowledge by emphasizing that especially belongingness needs that exceed relationship satisfaction, regardless of the actual levels of both, contribute to actual health outcomes. Thus, high need to belong is not detrimental per se, but only in combination with low relationship satisfaction. Implications for clinical practice could be to prevent unmet belongingness needs to ultimately alleviate negative affect and self-esteem.","[Verhagen, Maaike] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Behav Sci, POB 9104, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Lodder, Gerine M.

Informed by the strength model of self-regulation, four studies (N = 546) tested the hypothesis that willingness to plan is linked to good self-control. A correlational study (N = 201) found that people high in trait self-control had done more planning than other people and also intended to make more plans during the upcoming week. A laboratory experiment (N = 105) induced a state of ego depletion (i.e., impaired self-control) by having some participants continuously break pre-established motoric habits, and afterward these participants were less willing to make plans for the next four weeks than control participants. A field experiment (N = 112) used a naturally occurring induction of decision fatigue (IKEA shopping) and again found that ego depletion reduced planning. Specifically, fatigued shoppers exiting the store expressed more reluctance to make long-term plans than shoppers who were just arriving at the store. A final laboratory experiment (N = 128) found that ego-depleted participants were only half as likely to choose a planning task as control participants, and identified effort avoidance as a mediator mechanism. Crucially, the three experimental manipulations were longer and stronger than the 5-min depletion tasks often used in previous research (24 min; 2 h; 30 min), and manipulation checks confirmed severe and significant ego depletion. Depletion had no effects on aspirational goals or the desire to relax. We conclude that wants and desires come easily, while planning requires mental work akin to self-control.

Narcissists tend to rise to-and abuse-positions of power, so we considered the possibility that positions of power may corrupt because they inflate narcissism. Two pathways were considered: Powerholders abuse their power because having power over others makes them feel superior (grandiosity pathway) or deserving of special treatment (entitlement pathway). Supporting the entitlement pathway, assigning participants to a position of power (vs. equal control) over a group task increased scores on the Exploitative/Entitlement component of narcissism among those with high baseline testosterone. What is more, heightened Exploitative/Entitlement scores among high-testosterone participants endowed with power (vs. equal control) statistically explained amplified self-reported willingness to misuse their power (e.g., taking fringe benefits as extra compensation). The grandiosity pathway was not well supported. The Superiority/Arrogance, Self-Absorption/Self-Admiration, and Leadership/Authority facets of narcissism did not change as a function of the power manipulation and testosterone levels. Taken together, these results suggest that people with high (but not low) testosterone may be inclined to misuse their power because having power over others makes them feel entitled to special treatment. This work identifies testosterone as a characteristic that contributes to the development of the socially toxic component of narcissism (Exploitative/Entitlement). It points to the possibility that structural positions of power and individual differences in narcissism may be mutually reinforcing, suggesting a vicious cycle with personal, relational, and societal implications.","[Mead, Nicole L.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Management & Mkt, Fac Business & Econ, Level 10,198 Berkeley St, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Stuppy, Anika] Erasmus Univ, Dept Mkt Management, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Vohs, Kathleen D.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Mkt, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Mead, NL (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Management & Mkt, Fac Business & Econ, Level 10,198 Berkeley St, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",nicole.mead@unimelb.edu.au,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016; Mead, Nicole/L-7675-2019; Mead, Nicole/Q-7856-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Stuppy, Anika/0000-0002-7604-5622; Mead, Nicole/0000-0002-9621-4999",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Erasmus Research Institute of Management (ERIM),This work benefited from the support of a doctoral fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC; Nicole L.

There is still much to learn about self-esteem, but future work can improve by noting weaknesses in self-report data and correcting for confounds.","[Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Vohs, Kathleen D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Mkt, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",baumeister@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,12,7,7,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1745-6916,1745-6924,NA,PERSPECT PSYCHOL SCI,Perspect.

The first of four organizing questions concerns the nature of meaning. The meaning of signs (e.g., words) consists of nonphysical connection (e.g., symbolism) and potential organization. Meanwhile, existential meaning (meaning of life) involves purpose, value, mattering, continuity, and coherence. The second question concerns how meaning affects behavior. Answers are diverse and multifaceted, ranging from efforts to grapple with uncertainty and unknowns to engaging in significance-seeking violence and self-regulating in light of abstract values and standards. To the question of whether meaning is made or found, the authors propose that finding meaning is prevalent, while the creation of new meanings is only supported in a limited sense. Although often portrayed as a constructive process, accessing meaning normally involves relating target stimuli to what is already known. A fourth question asks whether meaning is individual/personal or collective/social. The collective dimension plays an integral yet often neglected role in scaffolding personal meanings.","[Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Landau, Mark J.] Univ Kansas, Dept Psychol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",baumeister@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,36,5,5,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1089-2680,1939-1552,NA,REV GEN PSYCHOL,Rev.

That is, much human social activity involves communicating and discussing information. This occurs in the context of incompletely shared information-but also a group's store of collective knowledge and shared understanding. This article elucidates a preliminary theory of self as information agent, proposing that human evolution instilled both abilities and motivations for the various requisite functions. These basic functions include (a) seeking and acquiring information, (b) communicating one's thoughts to others, (c) circulating information through the group, (d) operating on information to improve it, such as by correcting mistakes, and (e) constructing a shared understanding of reality. Sophisticated information agents exhibit additional features, such as sometimes selectively withholding information or disseminating false information for self-serving reasons, cultivating a reputation as a credible source of information, and cooperating with others to shape the shared worldview in a way that favors one's subgroup. Meaningful information is thus more than a resource for individual action: It also provides the context, medium, and content within which the individual self interacts with its social environment.","[Baumeister, Roy F.] Univ Queensland, Dept Psychol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Baumeister, Roy F.; Maranges, Heather M.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Vohs, Kathleen D.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Mkt Dept, 321 19th Ave South,Suite 3-150, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Vohs, KD (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Mkt Dept, 321 19th Ave South,Suite 3-150, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",vohsx005@umn.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,64,11,11,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1089-2680,1939-1552,NA,REV GEN PSYCHOL,Rev.

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that writing about conflicted personal goals and values (conflict condition) would impair self-control on an unrelated subsequent task as compared to writing about clear personal goals and values (clarity condition). Personal conflict activates the behavioral inhibition system (BIS; Hirsh, Mar, & Peterson, 2012), which may make it harder for participants to successfully execute self-control. In this large (N = 337), pre-registered study participants in the conflict condition performed worse on anagrams than participants in the clarity condition, and the effect of condition on anagram performance was mediated by a subjective uncertainty measure of BIS activation. This suggests that BIS activation leads to poor self-control. Moreover, given that conflict is inherent in the exercise of self-control, results point to BIS activation as a mechanism for why initial acts of self-control impair self-control on subsequent, unrelated tasks.","[Alquist, Jessica L.; Core, Tammy J.] Texas Tech Univ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Baumeister, Roy F.; Tice, Dianne M.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [McGregor, Ian] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Benjamin, Iljl] York Univ, N York, ON, Canada","Alquist, JL (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, Box 42051, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",jessica.alquist@ttu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [UL1-DE019586, 1RL1AA017541]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL &CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) [UL1DE019586, UL1DE019586, UL1DE019586, UL1DE019586, UL1DE019586, UL1DE019586] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [RL1AA017541, RL1AA017541, RL1AA017541, RL1AA017541, RL1AA017541] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This research was supported by NIH Roadmap for Medical Research Common Fund with the grants UL1-DE019586 and 1RL1AA017541.,NA,43,7,7,0,14,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0022-1031,1096-0465,NA,J EXP SOC PSYCHOL,J.

The present research tested two competing hypotheses about the consequence of depletion by measuring how people allocate rewards between themselves and another person. Seven experiments analyzed behavior in standard dictator games and reverse dictator games, settings in which participants could take money from another person. Across all of these experiments, depleted participants made smaller changes to the initial allocation, thereby sticking closer to the default position (anchor) than non-depleted participants. These findings provide support for a sticky anchor hypothesis, which states that the effects of depletion on behavior are influenced by the proximal situational cues rather than by directly stimulating selfishness per se.

We extend that theory to analyze same-gender contests in that marketplace, and to elaborate the idea that what the woman sells is not just sex but exclusive access to her sexual charms. Women compete on sex appeal and on the promise of exclusiveness (faithfulness), with the goal of getting a man who will provide material resources. Men compete to amass material resources, with the goal of getting a good sex partner. Female competition includes showing off her sexual charms, offering sex at a lower price than rivals, seeking to improve her physical assets (e.g., by dieting), and use of informational warfare to sully rivals' reputations while defending her own reputation against malicious gossip. We review evidence of these patterns, including evidence that female body dissatisfaction and pathological eating patterns increase when women perceive an unfavorable sex ratio (i.e., shortage of eligible men). Men compete in groups to amass resources, so men see other men not just as sexual rivals but also as coalition partners. Male homophobia is often not about sex but rather invokes the stereotype that a homosexual man will not be an effective coalition partner. Misunderstandings about whether sex or exclusivity is the central commitment can complicate marital adjustment for couples. (C) 2017 The Authors.

To resolve these seeming contradictions, we experimentally compared the effects of cognitive load and self-regulatory depletion. Ego depletion led participants to pay more attention to pain and to persist less on a pain test, whereas load had opposite effects (Study 1). Load distracted people from processing and reacting to negative emotional content of pictures (Study 2), and boosted positive feelings even without an overt emotion induction (Study 3), whereas depletion did not change how people felt relative to control. Depletion and load had equivalent null effects on visual recognition memory (Study 2) but different effects on semantic processing involving emotional connections (Study 3).

Conscious thought is particularly useful for logical reasoning, quantification (including about money), and communication, all of which are relevant to consumer behavior. We argue that most human behavior is produced by an interactive combination of conscious and unconscious causes and that favoring one over the other will yield an overly simplistic understanding of consumer behavior.

Study 2 found that higher state-level incarceration rates predicted higher mental health issue rates, only in states with citizens relatively skeptical about free will. In Study 3, participants who punished an unfair partner experienced greater distress than non-punishers, only when their partner did not have free choice. Studies 4 and 5 confirmed experimentally that punitive desires led to greater anxiety only when free will beliefs were undermined by an anti-free will argument.

Accordingly, development of self-control is widely encouraged. Whereas the benefits of having self-control are well documented, little is known about the impact of wanting self-control. The present investigation fills this void by exploring the effect of desire for self-control on the ability to exert self-control. It was expected that in the context of demanding self-control challenges, a desire for self-control will highlight a discrepancy between one's goals and perceived performance potential, leading to reduced efficacy beliefs and task disengagement. Four studies (N = 635) supported the prediction. Study 1 showed that a strong desire impaired performance on a demanding task but not on a simple task. Study 2 conceptually replicated the decrement in performance and established causality by experimentally manipulating desire for self-control. Studies 3 and 4 showed that reduction in efficacy beliefs mediate the effect.

While previous research shows that people generally hold positive beliefs about their futures, our analysis demonstrates that actively thinking about one's future engenders conservative behaviors to avoid potential losses or harm. In Experiment 1, writing about one's future self, compared to one's present self, caused people to favor low-risk, low payoff investments rather than high-risk, high-payoff ones. In Experiment 2, restating sentences about the future (as opposed to the present) reduced behavioral trust. Participants shared less money with various partners in a potentially lucrative investment game. That same manipulation of prospection in Experiment 3 increased blame for misdeeds While having no effect on praise for virtuous action. These finding suggest that, although people often hold optimistic beliefs about the future, prospection may lead people to behave cautiously as if wary about what could go wrong.","[Monroe, Andrew E.] Appalachian State Univ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Ainsworth, Sarah E.] Univ North Florida, Jacksonville, FL USA; [Vohs, Kathleen D.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Monroe, AE (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Dept Psychol, 222 Joyce Lawrence Ln, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",monroeae1@appstate.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Monroe, Andrew/0000-0002-9755-8726",John Templeton Foundation [032294],This project was supported by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation (Grant number 032294).

But the tendency may not be irrational. According to the Tradeoffs Justification Model, judgments of a person's intentions to cause harm depend on how that person decided to act, and on whether the reasons for acting justified causing the harmful consequences. Across three experiments (N = 660), unjustified harms were viewed as more intentional than justified harms. If the person had a choice of what to do and knowingly caused harm for no good reason, people judged that the person must have actually desired and intended to cause the harm. However, if the person had a strong, compelling reason (e.g., to ransom his daughter from kidnappers) that the observer deemed to have justified causing the harm, then observers thought the harm was weakly intended at most Taboo harms that violated sacred moral values were especially likely to be seen as intentional because most reasons do not adequately justify violating a sacred value.

The meta-analyses reported in this paper evaluated the relationship between social network site (SNS) use and 2 types of social capital: bridging social capital and bonding social capital. The meta-analyses included data from 58 articles gathered through scholarly databases and a hand search of the early publications of relevant journals. Using a random effects model, the overall effect size of the relationship between SNS use and bridging social capital based on k = 50 studies and N = 22,290 participants was r = .32 (95% CI [. 27,.37]), and the overall effect size between SNS use and bonding social capital based on k = 43 studies and N = 19,439 participants was r = .26 (95% CI [.22,.31]). The relationships between SNS use and both types of social capital were stronger in men than in women, and the relationship between SNS use and bridging capital was stronger in Western, individualistic countries than Eastern, collectivistic countries. Additional analyses of specific SNS activities indicated that SNS use promotes social capital by facilitating contact and interaction among people who already know each other offline rather than contact with people who were met online. The implication is that SNSs offer a platform to strengthen existing relationships.","[Liu, Dong] Renmin Univ China, Dept Psychol, Ctr Internet Plus Social Psychol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ainsworth, Sarah E.] Univ North Florida, Dept Psychol, Jacksonville, FL USA; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",baumeister@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016; Liu, Dong/O-3375-2015","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Liu, Dong/0000-0002-9654-7902",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [15XNLF08],"Dong Liu, Sarah E.

We examined the contribution of childhood self-control to early smoking initiation and smoking across adulthood. Methods: 21,132 participants were drawn from 2 nationally representative cohort studies; the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS) and the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS). Child self-control was teacher-rated at age 10 in the BCS and at ages 7 and 11 in the NCDS. Participants reported their smoking status and number of cigarettes smoked per day at 5 time-points in the BCS (ages 26-42) and 6 time-points in the NCDS (ages 23-55). Both studies controlled for socioeconomic background, cognitive ability, psychological distress, gender, and parental smoking; the NCDS also controlled for an extended set of background characteristics. Results: Early self-control made a substantial graded contribution to (not) smoking throughout life. In adjusted regression models, a 1-SD increase in self-control predicted a 6.9 percentage point lower probability of smoking in the BCS, and this was replicated in the NCDS (5.2 point reduced risk). Adolescent smoking explained over half of the association between self-control and adult smoking. Childhood self-control was positively related to smoking cessation and negatively related to smoking initiation, relapse to smoking, and the number of cigarettes smoked in adulthood. Conclusions: This study provides strong evidence that low childhood self-control predicts an increased risk of smoking throughout adulthood and points to adolescent smoking as a key pathway through which this may occur.","[Daly, Michael; Egan, Mark; Delaney, Liam] Univ Stirling, Behav Sci Ctr, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Daly, Michael; Delaney, Liam] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Geary Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Quigley, Jody] Univ Stirling, Div Psychol, Stirling, Scotland; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Daly, M (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Behav Sci Ctr, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",michael.daly@stir.ac.uk,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016; Daly, Michael/AAD-7703-2019","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Daly, Michael/0000-0003-1557-8326; Quigley, Jody/0000-0001-8289-3145; Delaney, Liam/0000-0002-3644-1161",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/L010437/1]; Economic and Social Research CouncilEconomic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/L010437/1] Funding Source: researchfish,This research was funded by an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Future Leaders grant (ES/L010437/1).,NA,52,18,18,1,22,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0278-6133,1930-7810,NA,HEALTH PSYCHOL,Health Psychol.,NOV,2016,35,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,1254,1263,NA,10.1037/hea0000393,NA,NA,10,"Psychology, Clinical; Psychology",Psychology,EA2TV,WOS:000386448700010,27607137,"Green Published, Other Gold",NA,NA,2021-02-02,NA,baumeister

Once self-control resources have been used up or depleted, they are less available for other self-control tasks, leading to a decrement in subsequent self-control success. The depletion effect has been studied for over 20 years, tested or extended in more than 600 studies, and supported in an independent meta-analysis (Hagger et al., 2010). Meta-analyses are supposed to reduce bias in literature reviews. Carter et al.'s (2015) meta-analysis, by contrast, included a series of questionable decisions involving sampling, methods, and data analysis. We provide quantitative analyses of key sampling issues: exclusion of many of the best depletion studies based on idiosyncratic criteria and the emphasis on mini meta-analyses with low statistical power as opposed to the overall depletion effect. We discuss two key methodological issues: failure to code for research quality, and the quantitative impact of weak studies by novice researchers. We discuss two key data analysis issues: questionable interpretation of the results of trim and fill and Funnel Plot Asymmetry test procedures, and the use and misinterpretation of the untested Precision Effect Test and Precision Effect Estimate with Standard Error (PEESE) procedures. Despite these serious problems, the Carter et al.

Total SNS use was higher, among people low in self-esteem, high in narcissism, and high in loneliness. Further analyses revealed high narcissism to be linked to all SNS activities (status updates, posting photographs, interacting/commenting on others, and total friends). High self-esteem (not low) was linked to having more online friends but no other activities. Links were stronger in studies with lower proportions of females and participants from non-Western, non-individualistic countries. We speculate that effects are somewhat diluted among females and Western samples by multiple reasons for SNS use, and further that low self-esteem participants constitute the so-called lurkers (i.e., people who browse but do not reveal themselves).

As predicted by escape theory, materialistic individuals may feel dissatisfied with their standard of living, cope with failed expectations and life stressors less effectively than others, suffer from aversive self-awareness, and experience negative emotions as a result. To cope with negative, self-directed emotions, materialistic people may enter a narrow, cognitively deconstructed mindset in order to temporarily blunt the capacity for self-reflection.

Building on Sakaluk's (in this issue) distinction between exploration and confirmation, I argue that this shift will increase correctness of findings, but at the expense of exploration and discovery. The likely effects on the field include aversion to risk, increased difficulty in building careers and hence more capricious hiring and promotion policies, loss of interdisciplinary influence, and rising interest in small, weak findings. Winners (who stand to gain from the mooted changes) include researchers with the patience and requisite resources to assemble large samples; incompetent experimenters; destructive iconoclasts; competing subfields of psychology; and lower-ranked journals, insofar as they publish creative work with small samples. The losers are young researchers; writers of literature reviews and textbooks; flamboyant, creative researchers with lesser levels of patience; and researchers at small colleges. My position is that the field has actually done quite well in recent decades, and improvement should be undertaken as further refinement of a successful approach, in contrast to the Cassandrian view that the field's body of knowledge is hopelessly flawed and radical, revolutionary change is needed. I recommend we retain the exploratory research approach alongside the new, large-sample confirmatory work.

We theorized that free will extends beyond morality to serve as the basis for accountability and the capacity for change more broadly, not only for others but also for the self. Five experiments showed that people attributed higher freedom of will to negative than to positive valence, regardless of morality or intent, for both self and others. In recalling everyday life situations and in classical decision making paradigms, negative actions, negatives outcomes, and negative framing were attributed higher free will than positive ones. Free will attributions were mainly driven by action or outcome valence, but not intent.

Yet recent evidence has suggested that people do not spend much time actively thinking about the past. The articles in this special issue reflect a growing sentiment that prospection should be a central focus of psychology. They are about 2 central themes: prediction and pragmatic planning. Prediction studies are largely about when people make predictions and their accuracy (including what mistakes people make). Pragmatic planning, which from evolutionary standpoints might be the more common and basic form of thinking about the future, involves anticipating what a person will have to do, decide, perform. The 2 approaches are quite compatible: prediction in service of pragmatic adjustments would be highly adaptive. To accurately imagine what might happen is likely not an end to itself, because that alone does not enable a person to make changes or ready oneself for the event if and when it comes to fruition. The articles in this special issue-whether on prospection, prediction, pragmatic planning, or prediction in service of preparation and planning-suggest avenues to pave the way for psychology's brightest future.","[Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Vohs, Kathleen D.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Vohs, KD (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Mkt, 321 19th Ave South, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",vohsx005@umn.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,3,11,11,1,7,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1089-2680,1939-1552,NA,REV GEN PSYCHOL,Rev.

Both facts derive from the principle that the future can be changed whereas the past cannot. Our theory of pragmatic prospection holds that people think about the future so as to guide actions to bring about desirable outcomes. It proposes that thoughts about the future begin by imagining what one wants to happen, which is thus initially optimistic. A second stage of such prospective thinking maps out how to bring that about, and this stage is marked by consideration of obstacles, requisite steps, and other potential problems, and so it tends toward cautious realism and even pessimism. Pragmatic prospection presents a form of teleology, in which brains can anticipate possible future events and use those cognitions to guide behavior. Toward that end, it invokes meaning, consistent with evidence that thinking about the future is highly meaningful. Prospection often has narrative structure, involving a series of events in a temporal sequence linked together by meaning. Emotion is useful for evaluating different simulations of possible future events and plans. Prospection is socially learned and rests on socially constructed scaffolding for the future (e.g., future dates). Planning is perhaps the most common form of prospection, and it exemplifies all aspects of our theory (including pragmatic utility, meaning, teleological and narrative structure, and sociality). Bracing for bad news and defensive pessimism are strategies that inspire adaptive responses to feared outcomes.","[Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1103 West Call St, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Vohs, Kathleen D.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Mkt, 3-150 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Oettingen, Gabriele] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Oettingen, Gabriele] Univ Hamburg, Dept Psychol, Hamburg, Germany","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1103 West Call St, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Vohs, KD (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Mkt, 3-150 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",baumeister@psy.fsu.edu; kvohs@umn.ed,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",John Templeton Foundation,We thank the John Templeton Foundation for support.,NA,100,46,47,3,50,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1089-2680,1939-1552,NA,REV GEN PSYCHOL,Rev.

The requirements for such a theory are presented here. The primacy of motivation emphasizes that cognition, emotion, agency, and other psychological processes exist to serve motivation. Both state (impulses) and trait (basic drives) forms of motivation must be explained, and their relationship must be illuminated. Not all motivations are the same, and indeed it is necessary to explain how motivation evolved from the simple desires of simple animals into the complex, multifaceted forms of human motivation. Motivation responds to the local environment but may also adapt to it, such as when desires increase after satiation or diminish when satisfaction is chronically unavailable. Addiction may be a special case of motivation-but perhaps it is much less special or different than prevailing cultural stereotypes suggest. The relationship between liking and wanting, and the self-regulatory management of motivational conflict, also require explanation by an integrative theory.","[Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",baumeister@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,26,36,37,2,37,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0146-7239,1573-6644,NA,MOTIV EMOTION,Motiv.

Research on groups has found that groups sometimes perform better and other times perform worse than the sum of their individual members. Differentiation of selves is a crucial moderator. We propose a heuristic framework that divides formation of work or task groups into two steps. One step emphasizes shared common identity and promotes emotional bonds. In the other step, which we emphasize, group members take increasingly differentiated roles that improve performance through specialization, moral responsibility, and efficiency. Pathologies of groups (e.g., social loafing, depletion of shared resources/commons dilemmas, failure to pool information, groupthink) are linked to submerging the individual self in the group. These pathologies are decreased when selves are differentiated, such as by individual rewards, individual competition, accountability, responsibility, and public identification. Differentiating individual selves contributes to many of the best outcomes of groups, such as with social facilitation, wisdom-of-crowds effects, and division of labor. Anonymous confidentiality may hamper differentiation by allowing people to blend into the group (so that selfish or lazy efforts are not punished), but it may also facilitate differentiation by enabling people to think and judge without pressure to conform. Acquiring a unique role within the group can promote belongingness by making oneself irreplaceable.","[Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Ainsworth, Sarah E.] Univ North Florida, Dept Psychol, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [Vohs, Kathleen D.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",baumeister@psy.fsu.edu; s.ainsworth@unf.edu; vohsx005@umn.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,499,16,16,7,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0140-525X,1469-1825,NA,BEHAV BRAIN SCI,Behav.

Study 2 showed that the belief in free will was a stronger predictor of life satisfaction, meaning in life, gratitude, and self-efficacy than either locus of control or implicit person theory. Study 3 showed that experimentally manipulating disbelief in free will caused a reduction in the perceived meaningfulness of life.

On average, a 1-SD increase in self-control was associated with a reduction in the probability of unemployment of 1.4 percentage points after adjustment for intelligence, social class, and gender. From labor-market entry to middle age, individuals with low self-control experienced 1.6 times as many months of unemployment as those with high self-control. Analysis of monthly unemployment data before and during the 1980s recession showed that individuals with low self-control experienced the greatest increases in unemployment during the recession.

Self-regulation and volition depend on a limited resource, and when that resource has been depleted, self-regulation becomes prone to fail. Moving beyond traditional models that have emphasized the relevance of self-regulation to quitting addiction, we propose that self-regulation is used both to facilitate and resist addictive behaviors. Self-regulation is often needed to overcome initial aversion to drugs and alcohol, as well as to maintain addictive usage patterns despite situational obstacles (e.g., illegality, erratic availability, family disapproval). Sustaining addiction also requires preventing use from spiraling out of control and interfering with other aspects of life. More generally, the automaticity and irresistibility of addictive responses may have been overrated, as indicated by how addictive behaviors respond rationally to incentives and other concerns. Self-regulation does facilitate quitting, and relapse may be especially likely when self-regulatory capabilities are depleted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

How do people assess how much they have learned? Recent theorizing has depicted emotion as a cue for learning, and so people may be misled by recent emotional states to infer that they have learned more than they actually have. Four studies showed that people associated emotion with learning and believed, often falsely, that they learned more when in an emotional than unemotional state. Factual lessons were coupled with manipulations of arbitrary, irrelevant emotional states. Participants rated that they learned more after an emotion had been induced than in emotionally neutral control conditions. These differences remained significant after controlling for actual learning as measured by objective tests, which was unaffected by emotion. This illusion of learning caused by emotion was robust with respect to changes of procedure and sample, including whether the emotion came before or after the information to be learned. Alternative explanations were ruled out, including that emotion would intensify ratings generally, that emotion would make incoming information seem particularly personally relevant, that emotion increased engagement in the research, and that illusory learning would depend on retrospective exaggeration of one's prior ignorance. Because irrelevant emotions can increase people's judgments that they have learned something, incidental emotional experiences could increase a person's likelihood of deciding to take another class with a particular instructor, to sign up for another leadership seminar, or to engage in a risky (but emotion-filled) excursion.

Empirical evidence suggests that, in test situations, brief perceptions of the color red or even the word red printed in black ink prime implicit anxious responses and consequently impair cognitive performance. However, we propose that this red effect depends on people's momentary capacity to exert control over their prepotent responses (i.e., self-control). In three experiments (Ns = 66, 78, and 130), first participants' self-control strength was manipulated. Participants were then primed with the color or word red versus gray prior to completing an arithmetic test or an intelligence test. As expected, self-control strength moderated the red effect. While red had a detrimental effect on performance of participants with depleted self-control strength (ego depletion), it did not affect performance of participants with intact self-control strength. We discuss implications of the present findings within the current debate on the robustness of priming results.","[Bertrams, Alex] Univ Mannheim, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Englert, Chris] Heidelberg Univ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Furley, Philip] German Sport Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany","Bertrams, A (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, A5,6, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",alex.bertrams@uni-mannheim.de,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016; Furley, Philip/V-2921-2019; Englert, Chris/V-7995-2017","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Englert, Chris/0000-0002-4757-8040",NA,NA,NA,92,29,29,2,68,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0146-1672,1552-7433,NA,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

As such, it depends on self-awareness and comparing oneself to standards and is also susceptible to fluctuations in willpower resources. Ego depletion is the state of reduced willpower caused by prior exertion of self-control. Ego depletion undermines inhibition both because restraints are weaker and because urges are felt more intensely than usual. Conscious inhibition of desires is a pervasive feature of everyday life and may be a requirement of life in civilized, cultural society, and in that sense it goes to the evolved core of human nature. Intentional inhibition not only restrains antisocial impulses but can also facilitate optimal performance, such as during test taking. Self-regulation and ego depletion may also affect less intentional forms of inhibition, even chronic tendencies to inhibit. Broadly stated, inhibition is necessary for human social life and nearly all societies encourage and enforce it. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Then participants learned about the trust game, in which senders are given an initial allocation of $10 to split between themselves and another person, the receiver. The receiver receives triple the amount given and can send any, all, or none of the tripled money back to the sender. Participants were assigned the role of the sender and decided how to split the initial allocation. Giving less money, and therefore not trusting the receiver, is the safe, less risky response. Participants who had exerted self-control and were depleted gave the receiver less money than those in the non-depletion condition (Experiment 1). This effect was replicated and moderated in two additional experiments. Depletion again led to lower amounts given (less trust), but primarily among participants who were told they would never meet the receiver (Experiment 2) or who were given no information about how similar they were to the receiver (Experiment 3). Amounts given did not differ for depleted and non-depleted participants who either expected to meet the receiver (Experiment 2) or were led to believe that they were very similar to the receiver (Experiment 3). Decreased trust among depleted participants was strongest among neurotics. These results imply that self-control facilitates behavioral trust, especially when no other cues signal decreased social risk in trusting, such as if an actual or possible relationship with the receiver were suggested.

The literature on dieting has sparked several debates over how restrained eaters differ from unrestrained eaters in their self-regulation of healthy and unhealthy food desires and what distinguishes successful from unsuccessful dieters. We addressed these debates using a four-component model of self-control that was tested using ecological momentary assessment, long-term weight change, and a laboratory measure of inhibitory control. Design. A large sample of adults varying in dietary restraint and inhibitory control (as measured by a Stroop task) were equipped with smartphones for a week. They were beeped on random occasions and provided information on their experience and control of healthy and unhealthy food desires in everyday environments. Main outcome measures. The main outcome measures were desire strength, experienced conflict, resistance, enactment of desire, and weight change after a 4-month follow-up. Results and conclusions. Dietary restraint was unrelated to desire frequency and strength, but associated with higher conflict experiences and motivation to use self-control with regard to food desires. Most importantly, relationships between dietary restraint and resistance, enactment of desire, and long-term weight change were moderated by inhibitory control: Compared with dieters low in response inhibition, dieters high in response inhibition were more likely to attempt to resist food desires, not consume desired food (especially unhealthy food), and objectively lost more weight over the ensuing 4 months. These results highlight the combinatory effects of aspects of the self-control process in dieters and highlight the value in linking theoretical process frameworks, experience sampling, and laboratory-based assessment in health science.","[Hofmann, Wilhelm] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Busines, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Adriaanse, Marieke] Univ Utrecht, Dept Clin & Hlth Psychol, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Vohs, Kathleen D.] Univ Minnesota, Carson Sch Business, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Hofmann, W (corresponding author), 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",wilhelm.hofmann@chicagobooth.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296","NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [RL1AA017541, RL1AA017541, RL1AA017541, RL1AA017541, RL1AA017541] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [RL1 AA017541, 1RL1AA017541] Funding Source: Medline",NA,NA,59,49,50,4,69,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1359-107X,2044-8287,NA,BRIT J HEALTH PSYCH,Br.

Potential explanatory constructs including goal conflict, goal balancing, and emotional distress also were investigated. TSC is positively related to affective well-being and life satisfaction, and managing goal conflict is a key as to why. All studies, moreover, showed that the effect of TSC on life satisfaction is at least partially mediated by affect. Study 1's correlational study established the effect. Study 2's experience sampling approach demonstrated that compared to those low in TSC, those high in TSC experience higher levels of momentary affect even as they experience desire, an effect partially mediated through experiencing lower conflict and emotional distress. Study 3 found evidence for the proposed mechanism-that TSC may boost well-being by helping people avoid frequent conflict and balance vice-virtue conflicts by favoring virtues.

It is often costly and prolonged, potentially increasing mortality rates, drug abuse, withdrawal from social life, and susceptibility to illness. These costs cannot be repaid by the deceased and therefore might appear wasted. In the following article, we propose a possible solution. Using the principles of social selection theory, we argue that an important selective pressure behind the human grief response was the social decisions of other humans. We combine this with insights from signaling theory, noting that grief shares many properties with other hard-to-fake social signals. We therefore contend that grief was shaped by selective forces to function as a hard-to-fake signal of (a) a person's propensity to form strong, non-utilitarian bonds and (b) a person's current level of commitment to a group or cause. This theory explains many of the costly symptoms of grief and provides a progressive framework for future research.","[Winegard, Bo M.; Reynolds, Tania; Baumeister, Roy F.; Maner, Jon K.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Winegard, Benjamin] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Winegard, BM (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, 1107 W Call St, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",winegard@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,199,11,11,1,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1088-8683,1532-7957,NA,PERS SOC PSYCHOL REV,Pers.

In Study 1, participants reported greater belief in free will after considering an immoral action than a morally neutral one. Study 2 provided evidence that this effect was due to heightened punitive motivations. In a field experiment (Study 3), an ostensibly real classroom cheating incident led to increased free will beliefs, again due to heightened punitive motivations. In Study 4, reading about others' immoral behaviors reduced the perceived merit of anti-free-will research, thus demonstrating the effect with an indirect measure of free will belief. Finally, Study 5 examined this relationship outside the laboratory and found that the real-world prevalence of immoral behavior (as measured by crime and homicide rates) predicted free will belief on a country level.

Those with high self-control displayed stable emotional patterns which explained the link between self-control and the cortisol slope.

Progress has been made by discarding outmoded philosophical notions in favor of exploring how ordinary people understand and use the notion of free will. The concept of responsible autonomy captures many aspects of layperson concepts of free will, including acting on one's own (i.e., not driven by external forces), choosing, using reasons and personal values, conscious reflection, and knowing and accepting consequences and moral implications. Free will can thus be understood as form of volition (action control) that evolved to enable people to live in cultural societies. Much work has shown that belief in free will (as opposed to disbelief) is associated with actions that are conducive to functioning well in culture, including helpfulness, restraint of aggression, learning via counterfactual analysis, thinking for oneself, effective job performance, and appropriate gratitude. Belief in free will increases in response to misdeeds by others, thus emphasizing the link to personal responsibility. Research on volition indicates that self-regulation, intelligent reasoning, decision making, and initiative all deplete a (common) limited energy source, akin to the folk notion of willpower and linked to the body's glucose supplies. Free will is thus not an absolute or constant property of persons but a variable, fluctuating capability one that is nonetheless highly adaptive for individuals and society. The notion that people have free will has been invoked in multiple contexts. Legally and morally, it explains why people can be held responsible for their actions. Theologically, it was used to explain why a supposedly kind and omniscient god would send most of the people he created to hell (Walker, 1964). Yet, for such an important concept, there remains wide-ranging disagreement and confusion over its existence and its nature. For example, philosophers still debate whether humans truly have free will and, if so, under what conditions human volition deserves to be considered free (Kane, 2011). In psychology, most theorists believe that humans engage in self-control, rational choice, planning, initiative, and related acts of volition. The debate is not whether these things occur but merely whether these should be called free will. This chapter will provide an overview of recent psychology experiments concerned with free will. There are three main and quite distinct sets of problems, each with associated lines of research. The first is concerned with how people understand the idea of free will. The second concerns the causes and consequences of believing in free will. The third focuses on the actual volitional processes that guide human action.","[Baumeister, Roy F.; Monroe, Andrew E.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",NA,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Monroe, Andrew/0000-0002-9755-8726",NA,NA,NA,142,28,28,2,91,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0065-2601,NA,978-0-12-800284-1,ADV EXP SOC PSYCHOL,Adv.

Happiness was largely present oriented, whereas meaningfulness involves integrating past, present, and future. For example, thinking about future and past was associated with high meaningfulness but low happiness. Happiness was linked to being a taker rather than a giver, whereas meaningfulness went with being a giver rather than a taker. Higher levels of worry, stress, and anxiety were linked to higher meaningfulness but lower happiness. Concerns with personal identity and expressing the self contributed to meaning but not happiness.

Thus, violent video games that are framed in an explicitly prosocial context may evoke more prosocial sentiments and thereby mitigate some of the short-term effects on aggression observed in previous research.

Yet as central as the conscious experience is to human life, numerous disciplines have long struggled to explain it. The present paper reviews the latest theories and evidence from psychology that addresses what conscious thought is and how it affects human behavior. We suggest that conscious thought adapts human behavior to life in complex society and culture. First, we review research challenging the common notion that conscious thought directly guides and controls action. Second, we present an alternative view that conscious thought processes actions and events that are typically removed from the here and now, and that it indirectly shapes action to favor culturally adaptive responses. Third, we summarize recent empirical work on conscious thought, which generally supports this alternative view. We see conscious thought as the place where the unconscious mind assembles ideas so as to reach new conclusions about how best to behave, or what outcomes to pursue or avoid. Rather than directly controlling action, conscious thought provides the input from these kinds of mental simulations to the executive. Conscious thought offers insights about the past and future, socially shared information, and cultural rules. Without it, the complex forms of social and cultural coordination that define human life would not be possible.","[Masicampo, E.

We found evidence for both, suggesting that people have both sets of meaningful associations, which can be differentially activated by exposure to clean versus dirty money. In a field experiment at a farmers' market, vendors who handled dirty money subsequently cheated customers, whereas those who handled clean money gave fair value (Experiment 1). In laboratory studies with economic games, participants who had previously handled and counted dirty money tended toward selfish, unfair practices unlike those who had counted clean money or dirty paper, both of which led to fairness and reciprocity. These patterns were found with the trust game (Experiment 2), the prisoner's dilemma (Experiment 4), the ultimatum game (Experiment 5), and the dictator game (Experiment 6). Cognitive measures indicated that exposure to dirty money lowered moral standards (Experiment 3) and reduced positive attitudes toward fairness and reciprocity (Experiments 6-7), whereas exposure to clean money had the opposite effects. Thus, people apparently have 2 contradictory sets of associations (including behavioral tendencies) to money, which is a complex, powerful, and ubiquitous aspect of human social life and cultural organization.","[Yang, Qing; Wu, Xiaochang; Zhou, Xinyue] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Psychol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xinyue] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Business Sch, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Mead, Nicole L.] Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Vohs, Kathleen D.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Zhou, XY (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Psychol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zhouxyue@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Mead, Nicole/L-7675-2019; Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016; Mead, Nicole/Q-7856-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Mead, Nicole/0000-0002-9621-4999",NA,NA,NA,33,38,44,6,287,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,NA,NA,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

Much psychological theory and practice, in contrast, has understood human action as determined by the past and viewed any such teleology (selection of action in light of goals) as a violation of natural law because the future cannot act on the present. Prospection involves no backward causation; rather, it is guidance not by the future itself but by present, evaluative representations of possible future states. These representations can be understood minimally as If X, then Y conditionals, and the process of prospection can be understood as the generation and evaluation of these conditionals. We review the history of the attempt to cast teleology out of science, culminating in the failures of behaviorism and psychoanalysis to account adequately for action without teleology. A wide range of evidence suggests that prospection is a central organizing feature of perception, cognition, affect, memory, motivation, and action. The authors speculate that prospection casts new light on why subjectivity is part of consciousness, what is free and willing in free will, and on mental disorders and their treatment. Viewing behavior as driven by the past was a powerful framework that helped create scientific psychology, but accumulating evidence in a wide range of areas of research suggests a shift in framework, in which navigation into the future is seen as a core organizing principle of animal and human behavior.","[Seligman, Martin E.

Desire strength, conflict, resistance, and self-regulatory success were moderated in multiple ways by personality variables as well as by situational and interpersonal factors such as alcohol consumption, the mere presence of others, and the presence of others who already had enacted the desire in question. Whereas personality generally had a stronger impact on the dimensions of desire that emerged early in its course (desire strength and conflict), situational factors showed relatively more influence on components later in the process (resistance and behavior enactment).

We replicated this difference but showed that it disappeared after control deprivation (Experiment 1). Brief experiences of control deprivation, which stimulate increased desire for control, caused Chinese participants to shift toward Western-style analytical thinking in multiple ways (Experiments 2-5). Western Caucasian participants also increased their use of analytical thinking after control deprivation (Experiment 6). Manipulations that required Chinese participants to think in Western, analytical ways caused their sense of personal control to increase (Experiments 7-9). Prolonged experiences of control deprivation, which past work suggested foster an attitude more akin to learned helplessness than striving for control, had the opposite effect of causing Chinese participants to shift back toward a strongly holistic style of thinking (Experiments 10-12). Taken together, the results support the reality of cultural differences in cognition but also the cross-cultural similarity of using analytical thinking when seeking to enhance personal control.","[Zhou, Xinyue; He, Lingnan; Lao, Junpeng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Psychol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xinyue] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Business Sch, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Lingnan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Sociocultural Studies & Mental Hlth, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lao, Junpeng] Univ Glasgow, Dept Psychol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Lao, Junpeng] Univ Glasgow, Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Zhou, XY (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Psychol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zhouxyue@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Lao, Junpeng/H-3649-2019; Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Lao, Junpeng/0000-0001-6029-7510",NA,NA,NA,61,31,39,2,69,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,NA,NA,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

The authors predicted that in public settings neuroticism would be associated with ego-depletion effects and individual differences in impression management (IM) would be associated with restoration effects. Three experiments supported the hypothesis. In Study 1 neuroticism was associated with impaired self-control and IM was associated with enhanced self-control following an initial phase of working on a simple task in public (vs. in private). Study 2 replicated and extended these results to other domains of self-control. Study 3 explored whether public social context can cancel out early depletion effects. In this study, depleted participants engaged in a task that required self-control either alone or in public. As expected, the public settings were associated with restored self-control resources mostly among high IM individuals. Implications for self-control, neuroticism, and IM are discussed.","[Uziel, Liad] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Psychol, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Uziel, L (corresponding author), Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Psychol, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",liaduziel@gmail.com,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016; Uziel, Liad/AAR-8754-2020","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Uziel, Liad/0000-0001-9401-8567","NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [RL1AA017541, RL1AA017541, RL1AA017541, RL1AA017541, RL1AA017541] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [1RL1AA017541] Funding Source: Medline",NA,NA,45,19,20,2,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0146-1672,NA,NA,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

The present work demonstrates that while plans generally make people more likely to act on a goal, they may sometimes lead to failure rather than to success, particularly when recognizing and seizing an alternative opportunity is essential for achieving the goal. Participants were assigned a goal in the lab, with sufficient or insufficient time and with a specific plan or broad intention to attain it. With sufficient (unlimited) time, a specific plan increased attainment, thus replicating the usual benefit of planning. Within the insufficient time condition, however, the specific plan impaired performance, because participants failed to capitalize on an alternative opportunity for achieving the goal. When openness to alternatives is crucial to success, plans can drastically decrease overall rates of attainment.","[Masicampo, E.

They report the results of a meta-analysis of 102 studies (total N = 32,648) investigating the behavioral effects of self-control using the Self-Control Scale, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and the Low Self-Control Scale. A small to medium positive effect of self-control on behavior was found for the three scales. Only the Self-Control Scale allowed for a fine-grained analysis of conceptual moderators of the self-control behavior relation. Specifically, self-control (measured by the Self-Control Scale) related similarly to the performance of desired behaviors and the inhibition of undesired behaviors, but its effects varied dramatically across life domains (e.g., achievement, adjustment). In addition, the associations between self-control and behavior were significantly stronger for automatic (as compared to controlled) behavior and for imagined (as compared to actual) behavior.","[de Ridder, Denise T.

The standard assumption has been that such cognitive activation persists until the goal is fulfilled. However, we predicted that contributing to goal pursuit through plan making could satisfy the various cognitive processes that usually promote goal pursuit. In several studies, we activated unfulfilled goals and demonstrated persistent goal activation over time. Unfinished goals caused intrusive thoughts during an unrelated reading task (Studies 1 and 5B), high mental accessibility of goal-related words (Studies 2 and 3), and poor performance on an unrelated anagram task (Study 4). Allowing participants to formulate specific plans for their unfulfilled goals eliminated the various activation and interference effects. Reduction of the effects was mediated by the earnestness of participants' plans: Those who ultimately executed their plans were those who also exhibited no more intrusions (Study 4). Moreover, changes in goal-related emotions did not appear to be a necessary component of the observed cognitive effects (Studies 5A and 5B). Committing to a specific plan for a goal may therefore not only facilitate attainment of the goal but may also free cognitive resources for other pursuits. Once a plan is made, the drive to attain a goal is suspended-allowing goal-related cognitive activity to cease-and is resumed at the specified later time.","[Masicampo, E.

The results strongly and consistently indicated that acute social exclusion increased nonconscious positive affect. Compared to nonexcluded participants, excluded participants recalled more positive memories from childhood than did accepted participants (Experiment 1), gave greater weight to positive emotion in their judgments of word similarity (Experiments 2 and 3), and completed more ambiguous word stems with happy words (Experiments 4a and 4b). This process was apparently automatic, as participants asked to imagine exclusion overestimated explicit distress and underestimated implicit positivity (Experiment 3). Four final experiments showed that this automatic emotion regulation process was found among participants low (but not high) in depressive symptoms (Experiments 5 and 6) and among participants high (but not low) in self-esteem (Experiments 7 and 8).

Five studies examined whether the processes associated with unfulfilled goals would interfere with tasks that require the executive function, which has a limited focal capacity and can pursue only one goal at a time. In Studies 1 and 2, activating a goal nonconsciously and then manipulating unfulfillment caused impairments on later tasks requiring fluid intelligence (solving anagrams; Study 1) and impulse control (dieting; Study 2). Study 3 showed that impairments were specific to executive functioning tasks: an unfulfilled goal impaired performance on logic problems but not on a test of general knowledge (only the former requires executive functions). Study 4 found that the effect was moderated by individual differences; participants who reported a tendency to shift readily amongst their various pursuits showed no task interference. Study 5 found that returning to fulfill a previously frustrated goal eliminated the interference effect. These findings provide converging evidence that unfulfilled goals can interfere with later tasks, insofar as they require executive functions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Results consistently favored the totality model: the more total self-control, the better the relationship fared. Multiple benefits were found for having mutually high self-control, including relationship satisfaction, forgiveness, secure attachment, accommodation, healthy and committed styles of loving, smooth daily interactions, absence of conflict, and absence of feeling rejected. These effects might be due to high-self-control partners' use of accommodation when there is miscommunication or problems in the relationship.

Relative to controls, excluded participants were more likely to buy a product symbolic of group membership (but not practical or self-gift items), tailor their spending preferences to the preferences of an interaction partner, spend money on an unappealing food item favored by a peer, and report being willing to try an illegal drug, but only when doing so boosted their chances of commencing social connections.

We review studies with random assignment to experimental manipulations of conscious thought and behavioral dependent measures. Topics include mental practice and simulation, anticipation, planning, reflection and rehearsal, reasoning, counterproductive effects, perspective taking, self-affirmation, framing, communication, and overriding automatic responses. The evidence for conscious causation of behavior is profound, extensive, adaptive, multifaceted, and empirically strong. However, conscious causation is often indirect and delayed, and it depends on interplay with unconscious processes. Consciousness seems especially useful for enabling behavior to be shaped by nonpresent factors and by social and cultural information, as well as for dealing with multiple competing options or impulses. It is plausible that almost every human behavior comes from a mixture of conscious and unconscious processing.","[Baumeister, Roy F.; Masicampo, E.

Contrary to them, recent evidence has suggested that links between emotion and behavior are largely indirect, often depending on learning by stimulating cognitive appraisal and anticipation of future emotional outcomes. We propose that one major function of the human emotion system is to foster positive social connections with other people, and these emotional patterns (such as guilt and empathy) contribute indirectly to prosocial behavior patterns. When emotions are not functioning properly - such as among psychopaths or recently rejected persons - emotions lose their ability to promote positive social connection, and that opens the way for antisocial behaviors.","[Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Lobbestael, Jill] Maastricht Univ, Dept Clin Psychol Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",baumeister@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Lobbestael, Jill/0000-0001-9205-3115",NA,NA,NA,61,15,16,0,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1478-9949,1478-9957,NA,J FORENSIC PSYCHI PS,J.

Our model suggests that power motivates self-regulation toward effective performance-unless the task is perceived as unworthy of leaders. Our 1st studies showed that power improves self-regulation and performance, even when resources for self-regulation are low (ego depletion). Additional studies showed that leaders sometimes disdain tasks they deem unworthy, by withholding effort (and therefore performing poorly). Ironically, during ego depletion, leaders skip the appraisal and, therefore, work hard regardless of task suitability, so that depleted leaders sometimes outperform nondepleted ones. Our final studies replicated these patterns wall different tasks and even with simple manipulation of framing and perception of the same task (Experiment 5).

In response to economic, political, and other disadvantages, women collectively restrict their sexuality to maintain a low supply relative to male demand, thereby ensuring a high price. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that sexual norms and practices would be more restrictive in countries marked by gender inequality than in countries where the genders were more equal. An international online sex survey (N>317,000) yielded four measures of sexual activity, and 37 nations' means on all four measures were correlated with independent (World Economic Forum) ratings of gender equality. Consistent with predictions, relatively high gender equality was associated with more casual sex, more sex partners per capita, younger ages for first sex, and greater tolerance/approval of premarital sex.","[Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Mendoza, Juan Pablo] VU Free Univ Amsterdam, Sch Business, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1107 W Call St, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",baumeister@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Mendoza, Juan P./0000-0002-4666-924X",NA,NA,NA,20,19,19,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-4545,NA,NA,J SOC PSYCHOL,J.

The current investigation tested the hypothesis that people would be able to detect a propensity for violence in other people, based only on a brief glance at their face. Participants estimated the propensity for violence in 87 registered sex offenders after seeing photos of them for 2 s each. Estimated likelihood of violence was significantly related to actual violent history, suggesting that violent tendencies can be accurately inferred from a brief look at a person's face. Cues indicative of high masculinity and high levels of male sex hormones (heavy brow, general facial masculinity, high physical strength, younger age) were related to accurate judgments. Other cues such as facial emotion and good grooming were not associated with an actual history of violence, but nevertheless correlated with raters' judgments. Although there were no sex differences in accuracy, on average women thought targets were more violent than men did. Findings speak to the accuracy and efficiency with which people can detect potential threats to physical well-being. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Instead, we propose that conscious thought is for internal processing, to facilitate downstream interaction with the social and cultural environment. Human consciousness enables the construction of meaningful, sequential thought, as in sentences and narratives, logical reasoning, counting and quantification, causal understanding, narratives, and the simulation of events (including nonpresent ones). Conscious thought sequences resemble short films that the brain makes for itself, thereby enabling different parts of brain and mind to share information. The production of conscious thoughts is closely linked to the production of speech because the human mind evolved to facilitate social communication and information sharing, as culture became humankind's biological strategy. The influence of conscious thought on behavior can be vitally helpful but is mostly indirect. Conscious simulation processes are useful for understanding the perspectives of social interaction partners, for exploring options in complex decisions, for replaying past events (both literally and counterfactually) so as to learn, and for facilitating participation in culture in other ways.","[Baumeister, Roy F.; Masicampo, E.

These two types of pain-physical and social-may rely on some of the same behavioral and neural mechanisms that register pain-related affect. To the extent that these pain processes overlap, acetaminophen, a physical pain suppressant that acts through central (rather than peripheral) neural mechanisms, may also reduce behavioral and neural responses to social rejection. In two experiments, participants took acetaminophen or placebo daily for 3 weeks. Doses of acetaminophen reduced reports of social pain on a daily basis (Experiment 1). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure participants' brain activity (Experiment 2), and found that acetaminophen reduced neural responses to social rejection in brain regions previously associated with distress caused by social pain and the affective component of physical pain (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula). Thus, acetaminophen reduces behavioral and neural responses associated with the pain of social rejection, demonstrating substantial overlap between social and physical pain.","[DeWall, C.

This research examines the implications of the interplay between these two types of decision processes for context effects in choice by exploring the consequences of the depletion of executive resources in a prior, unrelated task. Building on a substantial body of psychological literature that points to a single underlying resource used for self-regulation and executive control, this article demonstrates that resource depletion has a systematic influence on choice in context. Specifically, resource depletion enhances the role of intuitive reasoning by impairing deliberate, careful processing. In five experiments, the authors find that resource depletion increases the share of reference-dependent choices, decreases the compromise effect, and magnifies the attraction effect. The results shed light on the mechanisms underlying context effects in choice and suggest that the scope of the depleted resource is not constrained to self-regulation activities but rather extends to choice in general.","[Pocheptsova, Anastasiya] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Dhar, Ravi] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Amir, On] Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Baumeister, Roy F.] Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Pocheptsova, A (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",apochept@rhsmith.umd.edu; oamir@ucsd.edu; ravi.dhar@yale.edu; baumeister@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,35,153,156,4,82,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0022-2437,1547-7193,NA,J MARKETING RES,J.

Two experiments tested the hypothesis that dishonesty would increase when people's self-control resources were depleted by an initial act of self-control. Depleted participants misrepresented their performance for monetary gain to a greater extent than did non-depleted participants (Experiment 1). Perhaps more troubling, depleted participants were more likely than non-depleted participants to expose themselves to the temptation to cheat, thereby aggravating the effects of depletion on cheating (Experiment 2).

Compared to accepted and control participants, socially excluded participants were more likely to rate aggressive and ambiguous words as similar (Experiment la), to complete word fragments with aggressive words (Experiment 1 b), and to rate the ambiguous actions of another person as hostile (Experiments 2-4). This hostile cognitive bias among excluded people was related to their aggressive treatment of others who were not involved in the exclusion experience (Experiments 2 and 3) and others with whom participants had no previous contact (Experiment 4).

These impairments affect not only self-control but also intelligent thought, effective decision making, and initiative.

No such improvement was found when the task was presented as diagnostic of good health.

Furthermore, poor performance among accepted participants was not due to self-handicapping or overconfidence. Offering accepted participants a cash incentive for self-regulating eliminated the self-regulation deficits. These findings provide evidence that the need to belong fits standard motivational patterns: Thwarting the drive intensifies it, whereas satiating it leads to temporary reduction in drive.

Nonconscious activation (priming) of the idea of logical reasoning increased the activation of logic-relevant concepts, but failed to improve logical reasoning performance (Experiments 2a-2c) unless the logical conclusions were largely intuitive and thus not reliant on logical reasoning (Experiment 3).

Our hypothesis was based on the assumption that effortful processes require and consume relatively large amounts of glucose (brain fuel), and that this use of glucose is why people use heuristic strategies after exerting self-control. Before performing any tasks, some participants drank lemonade sweetened with sugar, which restores blood glucose, whereas others drank lemonade containing a sugar substitute.

Consumer behavior should therefore be of central interest to a broad range of psychologists. These patterns include much of what is commonly understood as free will. Our approach to understanding free will sidesteps metaphysical and theological debates. Belief in free will is pervasive in human social life and contributes to its benefits. Evolution endowed humans with a new form of action control, which is what people understand by free will. Its complexity and flexibility are suited to the distinctively human forms of social life in culture, with its abstract rules, expanded time span, diverse interdependent roles, and other sources of opportunities and constraints. Self-control, planful action, and rational choice are vital forms of free will in this sense.

Motivational or framing factors can temporarily block the deleterious effects of being in a state of ego depletion. Blood glucose is an important component of the energy.","Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1107 W Call St, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",baumeister@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,21,1341,1405,37,479,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0963-7214,1467-8721,NA,CURR DIR PSYCHOL SCI,Curr.

This review suggests that blood glucose is one important part of the energy source of self-control. Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose. Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain (i.e., when insulin is low or insensitive). Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control. Numerous self-control behaviors fit this pattern, including controlling attention, regulating emotions, quitting smoking, coping with stress, resisting impulsivity, and refraining from criminal and aggressive behavior. Alcohol reduces glucose throughout the brain and body and likewise impairs many forms of self-control. Furthermore, self-control failure is most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose. Self-control benefits numerous social and interpersonal processes. Glucose might therefore be related to a broad range of social behavior.","Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Gailliot, MT (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",gailliot@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,217,332,345,6,118,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1088-8683,1532-7957,NA,PERS SOC PSYCHOL REV,Pers.

In three experiments, mortality salience produced an automatic coping response that involved tuning to positive emotional information. Subjects showed increased accessibility of positive emotional information (Experiments 1 and 3) and gave more weight to positive emotion in their judgments of word similarity (Experiment 2) after contemplating death than after thinking about dental pain. This automatic coping response was found both after a delay (Experiments 1 and 2) and directly after the mortality-salience manipulation, (Experiment 3), which suggests that the coping process begins immediately. Tuning to positive emotional information, in response to mortality salience was unconscious and counterintuitive (Experiment 3). These findings shed light on the coping process that ensues immediately following mortality salience and help to explain why a delay is often necessary to produce effects in line with terror management theory.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Psychol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","DeWall, CN (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Psychol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",cnathandewall@gmail.com,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,28,75,75,2,20,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0956-7976,NA,NA,PSYCHOL SCI,Psychol.

The actual likelihood of being duped, as well as the heightened vigilance for it, should increase as a function of opportunity (e.g., information asymmetry that gives one side a big advantage in knowledge) and motivation (e.g., an exceptionally huge payoff may make it worth defrauding a long-term business partner). Being duped produces an aversive self-conscious emotion with a threat of self-blame. There appears to be stable individual differences in the motivation (called sugrophobia) to avoid being a sucker. High sugrophobes will be vigilant and skeptical of potential deals. Low sugrophobes may not even realize in some instances that they were duped. The aversive reaction to feeling duped stimulates counterfactual ruminations that may intensify sugrophobia but also aids in extracting useful lessons.","Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Mkt, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychol, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada","Vohs, KD (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Mkt, 3-150 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",kvohs@carlsonschool.umn.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Chin, Jason/0000-0002-6573-2670",NA,NA,NA,63,60,60,0,21,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1089-2680,NA,NA,REV GEN PSYCHOL,Rev.

Behavior may also be chosen to pursue (or avoid) anticipated emotional outcomes. Rapid, automatic affective responses, in contrast to the full-blown conscious emotions, may inform cognition and behavioral choice and thereby help guide current behavior. The automatic affective responses may also remind the person of past emotional outcomes and provide useful guides as to what emotional outcomes may be anticipated in the present.

A single act of self-control causes glucose to drop below optimal levels, thereby impairing subsequent attempts at self-control.","Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Texas A&M Univ, Dept Psychol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",gailliot@psy.fsu.edu; baumeister@psy.fsu.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296; Plant, Elizabeth/0000-0002-1074-5087; Schmeichel, Brandon/0000-0003-3527-5365",NA,NA,NA,77,654,681,8,276,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,NA,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

Thus, the proximal cause of aggression is often failure of self-restraint. In five studies, depleted capacity for self-regulation (caused by prior, even irrelevant acts of self-regulation) increased aggressive responding, especially after an insulting provocation. When participants were insulted and their self-regulatory strength was depleted (i.e., after completing previous tasks that required self-regulation), participants were more likely to aggress. When the urge to aggress was relatively weaker (i.e., when participants were not insulted), self-regulatory depletion did not increase aggressive behavior. This effect was moderated by trait self-control: Participants low in trait self-control were particularly likely to express intentions of behaving aggressively in response to provocation, whereas participants high in trait self-control did not express intentions of responding aggressively.

Drawing primarily from social psychology research and theory, we conclude that audience support magnifies performance pressure and induces performers to avoid failure rather than seek success during the most critical moments of performance contests. Although supportive audiences can inspire performers to excel when motivation would otherwise be lacking, audiences may also lead performers towards maladaptive self-monitoring and overcautiousness when the stakes are highest. The increased self-focus that supportive audiences induce can disrupt the automatic execution of the skills performers possess. Dispositional and situational moderators of the relationship between audience support and performance are reviewed.","Trinity Univ, Dept Psychol, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA; Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Mkt Div, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada","Wallace, HM (corresponding author), Trinity Univ, Dept Psychol, 1 Trinity Pl, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA.",harry.wallace@trinity.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,45,74,75,2,66,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-0414,NA,NA,J SPORT SCI,J.

Societies will endow female sexuality, but not male sexuality with value (as in virginity, fidelity, chastity). The sexual activities of different couples are loosely interrelated by a marketplace, instead of being fully separate or private, and each couple's decisions may be influenced by market conditions. Economic principles suggest that the price of sex will depend on supply and demand, competition among sellers, variations in product, collusion among sellers, and other factors.

Teachers, parents, therapists, and others have focused efforts on boosting self-esteem, on the assumption that high self-esteem will cause many positive outcomes and benefits-an assumption that is critically evaluated in this review. Appraisal of the effects of self-esteem is complicated by several factors. Because many people with high self-esteem exaggerate their successes and good traits, we emphasize objective measures of outcomes. High self-esteem is also a heterogeneous category, encompassing people who frankly accept their good qualities along with narcissistic, defensive, and conceited individuals. The modest correlations between self-esteem and school performance do not indicate that high self-esteem leads to good performance. Instead, high self-esteem is partly the result of good school performance. Efforts to boost the self-esteem of pupils have not been shown to improve academic performance and may sometimes be counterproductive. Job performance in adults is sometimes related to self-esteem, although the correlations, vary widely, and the direction of causality has not been established. Occupational success may boost self-esteem rather than the reverse. Alternatively, self-esteem may be helpful only in some job contexts. Laboratory studies have generally failed to find that self-esteem causes good task performance, with the important exception that high self-esteem facilitates persistence after failure. People high in self-esteem claim to be more likable and attractive, to have better relationships, and to make better impressions on others than people with low self-esteem, but objective measures disconfirm most of these beliefs. Narcissists are charming at first but tend to alienate others eventually. Self-esteem has not been shown to predict the quality or duration of relationships. High self-esteem makes people more willing to speak up in groups and to criticize the group's approach. Leadership does not stem directly from self-esteem, but self-esteem may have indirect effects. Relative, to people with low self-esteem, those with high self-esteem show stronger in-group favoritism, which may increase prejudice and discrimination. Neither high nor low self-esteem is a direct cause, of violence. Narcissism leads,to increased aggression in retaliation, for wounded pride. Low self-esteem may contribute to externalizing behavior and delinquency, although some studies have found that there are no effects or that the effect of self-esteem vanishes when other variables are controlled. The highest and. lowest rates of cheating and bullying are found in different subcategories of high self-esteem. Self-esteem has a strong relation to happiness. Although the research has not clearly established causation, we are persuaded that high self-esteem does lead to greater happiness., Low self-esteem is more likely than high to lead to depression under some circumstances. Some studies support the buffer hypothesis, which is that high self-esteem mitigates the effects of stress, but other studies come to the opposite conclusion, indicating that I the negative effects of low self-esteem are, mainly felt in good times. Still others find that high self-esteem leads to happier outcomes regardless of stress or other circumstances. High self-esteem does not prevent children from smoking, drinking, taking drugs, or engaging in early sex. If anything high self-esteem fosters experimentation, which may increase early sexual activity or drinking, but in general effects of self-esteem are negligible. One important exception is that high self-esteem reduces the chances of bulimia in females. Overall, the benefits of high self-esteem fall into two categories: enhanced initiative and pleasant feelings. We have not found evidence that boosting self-esteem (by therapeutic, interventions or school programs) causes benefits. Our findings do not support continued widespread efforts to boost self-esteem in the hope that it will by itself foster improved outcomes. In view of the heterogeneity of high self-esteem, indiscriminate praise might just as easily promote narcissism, with its less desirable consequences. Instead, we recommend using praise to boost self-esteem as a reward for socially desirable behavior and self-improvement.","Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",NA,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016; Fahimifar, Sepideh/M-5303-2019","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296;",NA,NA,NA,230,1479,1530,45,755,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,1467-9280,NA,PSYCHOL SCI,Psychol.

People with low self-esteem appear to possess few resources for defending against rejection threat.","CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10010 USA; Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Sommer, KL (corresponding author), CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Dept Psychol, 55 Lexington Ave,Box B-8215, New York, NY 10010 USA.",kristin_sommer@baruch.cuny.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,57,103,109,3,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0146-1672,1552-7433,NA,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

In each study, narcissists performed better when self-enhancement opportunity was high rather than low. In contrast, the performance of participants with low narcissism was relatively unaffected by self-enhancement opportunity.

Reactance theory suggests that deprivation of specific sexual options will cause men to desire them more, to try to reclaim them by forcing sex and by aggressing against the woman who has refused them, and assorted findings support this analysis. Narcissism is proposed to moderate the link, especially because coercion is relatively rare in response to sexual refusals. Evidence about sexually coercive men supports the narcissism hypothesis, such as by showing self-serving cognitive distortions, an excessive concern with being admired, an inflated sense of entitlement, selectively low empathy, and a broadly exploitative approach to heterosexual relations.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Psychol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Psychol, 10900 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",rfb2@po.cwru.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,161,92,95,2,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1089-2680,1939-1552,NA,REV GEN PSYCHOL,Rev.

In this state, the self is less able to function effectively, such as by regulating itself or exerting volition. Effects of ego depletion appear to reflect an effort to conserve remaining resources rather than full exhaustion, although in principle full exhaustion is possible.

A large assortment of evidence supports 3 predictions based on the hypothesis of female erotic plasticity: (a) Individual women will exhibit more variation across time than men in sexual behavior, (b) female sexuality will exhibit larger effects than male in response to most specific sociocultural variables, and (c) sexual attitude-behavior consistency will be lower for women than men. Several possible explanations for female erotic plasticity are reviewed, including adaptation to superior male political and physical power, the centrality of female change (from no to yes) as a prerequisite for intercourse, and the idea that women have a milder sex drive than men.","Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Psychol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Psychol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",rfb2@po.cwru.edu,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,169,224,226,2,117,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0033-2909,NA,NA,PSYCHOL BULL,Psychol.

Exerting self-cont ol may consume self-control strength, reducing the amount of strength available for subsequent self-control efforts. Coping with stress, regulating negative affect, and resisting temptations require self-control, and after such self-control efforts, subsequent attempts at self-control are more likely to fail. Continuous self-control efforts, such as vigilance, also degrade over time. These decrements in self-control are probably not due to negative moods or learned helplessness produced by the initial self-control attempt. These decrements appear to be specific to behaviors that involve self-control: behaviors that do not require self-control neither consume nor require self-control strength.

Undoing, in the sense of counterfactual thinking, is also well documented but does not serve to defend against the threat. Projection is evident, but the projection itself may be a by-product of defense rather than part of the defensive response itself.

A new model of projection is presented in this article. People might try to actively suppress thoughts about the possibility that they have undesirable personality traits, but it was hypothesized that this response to threat ultimately causes thoughts about the unwanted traits to become chronically accessible. As a result, those trait concepts will be used to interpret others' behavior. Studies 1-4 showed that those people who both avoid thinking about having threatening personality traits and deny possessing them (repressors) also readily infer those traits from others' behavior. Studies 5-6 provided experimental support for the model. Unfavorable traits were attributed to participants, who, when they were asked or predisposed to not think about the traits, subsequently projected them onto someone else.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, DEPT PSYCHOL, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA","Newman, LS (corresponding author), UNIV ILLINOIS, DEPT PSYCHOL, 1007 W HARRISON ST, CHICAGO, IL 60607 USA.",NA,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296","NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [5 F32 MH09802-02] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [F32MH009802, F32MH009802] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",NA,NA,107,112,113,0,23,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,NA,NA,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

Myths about self-destructive patterns have included mistaken notions about masochism, suicide, spouse abuse, and guilt. Many myths have shared the assumption that people come to want suffering and failure, but the present essay argues on the basis of an extensive literature review that there is no empirical support for such a motivational pattern. Instead, many behaviors that seem superficially to reflect self-destructive motives can in fact be better understood as arising from other, more positive motives, such as the desire to escape from self-awareness. Empirical work has found systematic patterns of self-defeating behaviors, particularly emphasizing tradeoffs that burden desirable rewards with risks and costs, and systematic patterns of misregulation of self that involve counterproductive strategies. Contrary to the familiar view of self-destruction as arising from low self-esteem, it is shown that egotism and high self-esteem, typically combined with some threat of losing esteem, can be a cause of self-destructive actions.","UNIV BAMBERG,LEHRSTUHL PSYCHOL 4,D-96045 BAMBERG,GERMANY","Baumeister, RF (corresponding author), CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,CLEVELAND,OH 44106, USA.",NA,"Schutz, Astrid/U-4113-2018; Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Schutz, Astrid/0000-0002-6358-167X; Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,186,6,6,0,16,HOGREFE-VERLAG GMBH & CO,GOTTINGEN,"ROHNSWEG 25, D-37085 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY",0033-3042,NA,NA,PSYCHOL RUNDSCH,Psychol.

Both spontaneous and partner-induced guilt were studied using first-person accounts of interpersonal transgressions and guilt manipulations. Guilt was associated with transgressions against valued partners in close relationships, especially involving interpersonal neglect, unfilled obligations, and selfish actions. Feeling guilty was associated with higher rates of learning lessons, changing subsequent behavior, apologizing, confessing the transgression, and recognizing how a relationship partner's standards and expectations differ from one's own. Inducing guilt also appears to be a costly but effective way of influencing the behavior of relationship partners.

Belongingness appears to have multiple and strong effects on emotional patterns and on cognitive processes. Lack of attachments is linked to a variety of ill effects on health, adjustment, and well-being. Other evidence, such as that concerning satiation, substitution, and behavioral consequences, is likewise consistent with the hypothesized motivation.

Regarding the latter, four needs for meaning are proposed as guiding narrative thought. First, people interpret experiences relative to purposes, which may be either objective goals or subjective fulfillment states. Second, people seek value and justification by constructing stories that depict their actions and intentions as right and good.

Despite this assumed power of praise, and despite its salience and frequency in human social interaction, research interest in praise has been sporadic and intermittent, and not united within an all-embracing theoretical model. In this article we will present an analysis of the effects of praise. We will begin by considering how to define praise. Next, we will examine the view of praise as social reinforcement, a conception which roots praise firmly within an empiricist framework; this appears to have been the predominant theoretical view guiding previous research on praise. We will conclude, however, that this view is conceptually inadequate to account for the empirical evidence. Because of that conclusion, our next step will be to provide a novel examination of the likely processes and consequences involved in praise.

In particular, guilt patterns appear to be strongest, most common, and most consistent in the context of communal relationships, which are characterized by expectations of mutual concern.

Ego threat, however, caused Ss with high self-esteem to set inappropriate, risky goals that were beyond their performance capabilities so they ended up with smaller rewards than Ss with low self-esteem. The results indicate the danger of letting egotistical illusions interfere with self-regulation processes.","HARVARD UNIV, DEPT PSYCHOL, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA","BAUMEISTER, RF (corresponding author), CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV, DEPT PSYCHOL, 10900 EUCLID AVE, CLEVELAND, OH 44106 USA.",NA,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016; Heatherton, Todd F/H-5478-2011","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296;","NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH 43826-02] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH043826, R01MH043826] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",NA,NA,81,307,312,3,81,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,NA,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

In Experiment 2, self-aware subjects showed greater resistance to weak persuasive arguments than to strong arguments, unlike subjects who were not made self-aware. These results support the view of self-awareness as a cause of biased central route processing and (hence) of selective, judicious resistance to persuasion.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,CLEVELAND,OH 44106",NA,NA,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,30,32,32,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320",0146-1672,NA,NA,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

We propose that teasing consists of a communication, directed by an agent to a target, which synthesizes elements of aggression, humor, and ambiguity. Teasing messages are not meant literally, and often they exaggerate or overstate the intended derogation. For the target, making an attribution for the teaser's intention may be a complex task, and incorrect decoding may cause misunderstandings. Teasers see their motives as benign and friendly, whereas targets, especially young children, often experience teasing as hostile and painful. Social patterns suggest that teasing is an expression of status dominance and a mechanism for promoting conformity within groups. Much teasing occurs as a power-oriented interaction in which bullies dominate unassertive children, but there are also playful and beneficial aspects of teasing.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,CLEVELAND,OH 44106","SHAPIRO, JP (corresponding author), CHILD GUIDANCE CTR GREATER CLEVELAND,2525 E 22ND ST,CLEVELAND,OH 44115, USA.",NA,"Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,18,111,113,0,13,GUILFORD PUBLICATIONS INC,NEW YORK,"72 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10012",0736-7236,NA,NA,J SOC CLIN PSYCHOL,J.

Binge eaters suffer from high standards and expectations, especially an acute sensitivity to the difficult (perceived) demands of others. When they fall short of these standards, they develop an aversive pattern of high self-awareness, characterized by unflattering views of self and concern over how they are perceived by others. These aversive self-perceptions are accompanied by emotional distress, which often includes anxiety and depression. To escape from this unpleasant state, binge eaters attempt the cognitive response of narrowing attention to the immediate stimulus environment and avoiding broadly meaningful thought. This narrowing of attention disengages normal inhibitions against eating and fosters an uncritical acceptance of irrational beliefs and thoughts. The escape model is capable of integrating much of the available evidence about binge eating.","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,CLEVELAND,OH 44106","HEATHERTON, TF (corresponding author), HARVARD UNIV,DEPT PSYCHOL,33 KIRKLAND ST,CAMBRIDGE,MA 02138, USA.",NA,"MASCARENHAS, PEDRO H/G-5824-2010; Heatherton, Todd F/H-5478-2011; Baumeister, Roy F/R-7232-2016","Baumeister, Roy F/0000-0003-1413-3296",NA,NA,NA,271,1219,1229,10,208,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242",0033-2909,NA,NA,PSYCHOL BULL,Psychol.

This study examined 2013 9-10 year olds in the first data release from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development 21-site consortium study in order to identify resting state functional connectivity patterns that predict individual-differences in three domains of higher-order cognitive functions: General Ability, Speed/Flexibility, and Learning/Memory. For General Ability scores in particular, we observed consistent cross-site generalizability, with statistically significant predictions in 14 out of 15 held-out sites. These results survived several tests for robustness including replication in split-half analysis and in a low head motion subsample. We additionally found that connectivity patterns involving task control networks and default mode network were prominently implicated in predicting differences in General Ability across participants. These findings demonstrate that resting state connectivity can be leveraged to produce generalizable markers of neurocognitive functioning. Additionally, they highlight the importance of task control-default mode network interconnections as a major locus of individual differences in cognitive functioning in early adolescence.","[Sripada, Chandra; Rutherford, Saige; Angstadt, Mike; Weigard, Alexander; Heitzeg, Mary] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Thompson, Wesley K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Div Biostat, Dept Family Med & Publ Hlth, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Luciana, Monica] Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Hyde, Luke H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Inst Social Res, Ctr Human Growth & Dev, Ann Arbor, MI USA","Sripada, C (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sripada@umich.edu,"; Angstadt, Mike/K-2942-2016","Heitzeg, Mary/0000-0002-6737-2971; Rutherford, Saige/0000-0003-3006-9044; Sripada, Chandra/0000-0001-9025-6453; Angstadt, Mike/0000-0003-4870-7649; Hyde, Luke/0000-0002-5947-7896","NIAAA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [T32 AA007477] Funding Source: Medline; NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [U01 DA041048, U24 DA041147, U01 DA041093, U24 DA041123, U01 DA041028, U01 DA041025, U01 DA041156, U01 DA041089, U01 DA041106, U01 DA041117, U01 DA041148, U01 DA041174, U01 DA041120, U01 DA041134, U01 DA041022] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH107741] Funding Source: Medline",NA,NA,59,8,8,0,1,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1359-4184,1476-5578,NA,MOL PSYCHIATR,Mol.

In this study, we used a verbalized thought protocol to investigate clump-and-jump structure in SST-clusters of related thoughts about a topic followed by a jump to a new topic, in a repeating pattern. Several lines of evidence convergently supported the presence of clump-and-jump structure: high interrater agreement in identifying jumps, corroboration of rater-assigned jumps by automated text analytic methods, identification of clumps and jumps by a data-driven algorithm, and the inferred presence of clumps and jumps in unverbalized SST. We also found evidence that jumps involve a discontinuous shift in which a new clump is only modestly related to the previous one. These results illuminate serial structure in SST and invite research into the processes that generate the clump-and-jump pattern.","[Sripada, Chandra] Univ Michigan, Dept Philosophy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sripada, Chandra; Taxali, Aman] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Sripada, C (corresponding author), 2215 Angell Hall 435 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sripada@umich.edu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,70,1,1,3,3,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1053-8100,1090-2376,NA,CONSCIOUS COGN,Conscious.

Four prominent views define mind-wandering as (a) task-unrelated thought, (b) stimulus-independent thought, (c) unintentional thought, or (d) dynamically unguided thought. Although theorists claim to capture the ordinary understanding of mind-wandering, no systematic studies have assessed these claims. Two large factorial studies present participants (N = 545) with vignettes that describe someone's thoughts and ask whether her mind was wandering, while systematically manipulating features relevant to the four major accounts of mind-wandering. Dynamics explains between four and 40 times more variance in participants' mind-wandering judgments than other features. Our third study (N = 153) tests and supports a unique prediction of the dynamic framework-obsessive rumination contrasts with mind-wandering. Our final study (N = 277) used vignettes that resemble mind-wandering experiments. Dynamics had significant and large effects, while task-unrelatedness was nonsignificant. These results strongly suggest that the central feature of mind-wandering is its dynamics.","[Irving, Zachary C.; Glasser, Aaron] Univ Virginia, Corcoran Dept Philosophy, 102 Cocke Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Gopnik, Alison; Pinter, Verity] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, 3210 Tolman Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Sripada, Chandra] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sripada, Chandra] Univ Michigan, Dept Philosophy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Irving, ZC (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Corcoran Dept Philosophy, 102 Cocke Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",zci7c@virginia.edu,NA,"Irving, Zachary/0000-0002-6621-5202; Gopnik, Alison/0000-0002-7183-0867; Sripada, Chandra/0000-0001-9025-6453",John Templeton Foundation: The Science & Philosophy of Self Control (49684) and Summer Seminars in Neuroscience and Philosophy (48365) Funding Source: Medline; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Postdoctoral Fellowship (756-2015-0715) Funding Source: Medline,NA,NA,44,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0364-0213,1551-6709,NA,COGNITIVE SCI,Cogn.

Identifying brain-based markers of GCA has been a longstanding goal of cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Recently, predictive modeling methods have emerged that build whole-brain, distributed neural signatures for phenotypes of interest. In this study, we employ a predictive modeling approach to predict GCA based on fMRI task activation patterns during the N-back working memory task as well as six other tasks in the Human Connectome Project dataset (n = 967), encompassing 15 task contrasts in total. We found tasks are a highly effective basis for prediction of GCA: The 2-back versus 0-back contrast achieved a 0.50 correlation with GCA scores in 10-fold cross-validation, and 13 out of 15 task contrasts afforded statistically significant prediction of GCA. Additionally, we found that task contrasts that produce greater frontoparietal activation and default mode network deactivation-a brain activation pattern associated with executive processing and higher cognitive demand-are more effective in the prediction of GCA. These results suggest a picture analogous to treadmill testing for cardiac function: Placing the brain in a more cognitively demanding task state significantly improves brain-based prediction of GCA.","[Sripada, Chandra; Angstadt, Mike; Rutherford, Saige; Taxali, Aman] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Shedden, Kerby] Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Sripada, C (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sripada@umich.edu,"Rutherford, Saige/ABD-9680-2020","Sripada, Chandra/0000-0001-9025-6453; Rutherford, Saige/0000-0003-3006-9044",Dana Foundation David Mahoney Neuroimaging Program; National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH107741],"Dana Foundation David Mahoney Neuroimaging Program; National Institute of Mental Health, Grant/Award Number: R01MH107741",NA,80,2,2,3,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1065-9471,1097-0193,NA,HUM BRAIN MAPP,Hum.

However, clinical neuroimaging studies using this task have yielded conflicting results, raising basic questions about what the task measures and which aspects of the task relate to clinical outcomes. We used computational modeling to provide a clearer understanding of how neural activations from this task relate to the cognitive mechanisms that underlie performance and to probe the implications of these relationships for clinical research. METHODS: A total of 143 young adults (8-21 years of age) performed the go/no-go task during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. We used the diffusion decision model (DDM), a cognitive modeling approach, to quantify distinct neurocognitive processes that underlie go/no-go performance. We then assessed correlations between DDM parameters and brain activation from standard go/no-go contrasts and assessed relationships of DDM parameters and associated neural measures with clinical ratings. RESULTS: Right-lateralized prefrontal activations on correct inhibition trials, which are generally assumed to isolate neural processes involved in inhibition, were unrelated to DDM parameters (and other performance indices). However, responses to failed inhibitions in brain regions associated with error monitoring were strongly related to more efficient task performance and correlated with externalizing behavior and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings cast doubt on conventional interpretations of go/no-go task-related activations as reflecting the neural basis of inhibitory functioning. We instead found evidence that error-related contrasts provide clinically relevant information about neural systems involved in monitoring and optimizing the efficiency of cognitive performance.","[Weigard, Alexander; Soules, Mary; Ferris, Bailey; Zucker, Robert A.; Sripada, Chandra; Heitzeg, Mary] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Rachel Upjohn Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Weigard, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Rachel Upjohn Bldg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",asweigar@med.umich.edu,NA,"Sripada, Chandra/0000-0001-9025-6453; Ferris, Bailey/0000-0003-0135-2908; Heitzeg, Mary/0000-0002-6737-2971","National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01 AA07065, R01 AA025790]; NIAAAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [T32 AA007477]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01AA025790, R01AA025790, R01AA025790] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This project was supported by National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) Grant Nos.

In domains where networks are discovered on multiple time series, the most common approach is to compute measures of association or similarity between all pairs of time series. The nodes in the resultant network correspond to time series, which are linked by edges weighted according to the association scores of their endpoints. Finally, the fully connected network is thresholded such that only the edges with stronger weights remain and the desired sparsity level is achieved. While this approach is feasible for small datasets, its quadratic (or higher) time complexity does not scale as the individual time series length and the number of compared series increase. Thus, to circumvent the inefficient and wasteful intermediary step of building a fully connected graph before network sparsification, we propose a fast network discovery approach based on probabilistic hashing. Our methods emphasize consecutiveness, or the intuition that time series following similar fluctuations in longer time-consecutive intervals are more similar overall. Evaluation on real data shows that our method can build graphs nearly 15 times faster than baselines (when the baselines do not run out of memory), while achieving accuracy comparable to, or better than, baselines in task-based evaluation. Furthermore, our proposals are general, modular, and may be applied to a variety of sequence similarity search tasks.","[Safavi, Tara; Koutra, Danai] Univ Michigan, Comp Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sripada, Chandra] Univ Michigan, Psychiat & Philosophy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Safavi, T (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Comp Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tsafavi@umich.edu,NA,NA,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IIS 1743088]; Trove.

It is an open question, however, whether connectomes differ across individuals in a correspondingly massive number of ways, or whether most differences take a small number of characteristic forms. We systematically investigated this question and found clear evidence of low-rank structure in which a modest number of connectomic components, around 50-150, account for a sizable portion of inter-individual connectomic variation. This number was convergently arrived at with multiple methods including estimation of intrinsic dimensionality and assessment of reconstruction of out-of-sample data. In addition, we show that these connectomic components enable prediction of a broad array of neurocognitive and clinical symptom variables at levels comparable to a leading method that is trained on the whole connectome. Qualitative observation reveals that these connectomic components exhibit extensive community structure reflecting interrelationships between intrinsic connectivity networks. We provide quantitative validation of this observation using novel stochastic block model-based methods. We propose that these connectivity components form an effective basis set for quantifying and interpreting inter-individual connectomic differences, and for predicting behavioral/clinical phenotypes.","[Sripada, Chandra; Angstadt, Mike; Rutherford, Saige; Kessler, Daniel; Yee, Mike] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kessler, Daniel; Kim, Yura; Levina, Elizaveta] Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Sripada, C (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sripada@umich.edu,"Angstadt, Mike/K-2942-2016; Rutherford, Saige/ABD-9680-2020; Kessler, Daniel/B-8512-2013","Angstadt, Mike/0000-0003-4870-7649; Rutherford, Saige/0000-0003-3006-9044; Yee, Michael/0000-0003-3688-5202; Kessler, Daniel/0000-0003-2052-025X; Sripada, Chandra/0000-0001-9025-6453","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1521551]; N.S.F. grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1646108]; Dana Foundation David Mahoney Neuroimaging Program;  [R01MH107741];  [U01DA041106]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH107741, R01MH107741] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [U01DA041106, U01DA041106, U01DA041106, U01DA041106, U01DA041106] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",C.S. was supported by R01MH107741 and U01DA041106.

To unite these modalities in a common model, we used joint independent component analysis, a multivariate, multimodal method that identifies cohesive components that span modalities. Based on recent network models of ADHD, we hypothesized that altered relationships between large-scale networks, in particular, default mode network (DMN) and task-positive networks (TPNs), would co-occur with structural abnormalities in cognitive regulation regions. For 756 human participants in the ADHD-200 sample, we produced gray and white matter volume maps with voxel-based morphometry, as well as whole-brain functional connectomes. Joint independent component analysis was performed, and the resulting transmodal components were tested for differential expression in ADHD versus healthy controls. Four components showed greater expression in ADHD. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, we observed reduced DMN-TPN segregation co-occurring with structural abnormalities in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, two important cognitive control regions. We also observed altered intranetwork connectivity in DMN, dorsal attention network, and visual network, with co-occurring distributed structural deficits. There was strong evidence of spatial correspondence across modalities: For all four components, the impact of the respective component on gray matter at a region strongly predicted the impact on functional connectivity at that region. Overall, our results demonstrate that ADHD involves multiple, cohesive modality spanning deficits, each one of which exhibits strong spatial overlap in the pattern of structural and functional alterations.","[Kessler, Daniel; Angstadt, Michael; Welsh, Robert C.; Sripada, Chandra] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Welsh, Robert C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Radiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Sripada, C (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Rachel Upjohn Bldg,Room 2743,4250 Plymouth Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sripada@umich.edu,"Angstadt, Mike/K-2942-2016; Kessler, Daniel/B-8512-2013","Angstadt, Mike/0000-0003-4870-7649; Kessler, Daniel/0000-0003-2052-025X","National Institutes of Health GrantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AA020297]; Center for Computational Medicine Pilot Grant; John Templeton Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [K23AA020297, K23AA020297, K23AA020297, K23AA020297, K23AA020297] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","C.S. was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant AA020297, Center for Computational Medicine Pilot Grant, and the John Templeton Foundation.",NA,76,40,40,0,26,SOC NEUROSCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0270-6474,1529-2401,NA,J NEUROSCI,J.

Neuroimaging investigations of ADHD have traditionally sought to detect localized abnormalities in discrete brain regions. Recent years, however, have seen the emergence of complementary lines of investigation into distributed connectivity disturbances in ADHD. Current models emphasize abnormal relationships between default network-involved in internally directed mentation and lapses of attention-and task positive networks, especially ventral attention network. However, studies that comprehensively investigate interrelationships between large-scale networks in ADHD remain relatively rare. Methods: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 757 participants at seven sites in the ADHD-200 multisite sample. Functional connectomes were generated for each subject, and interrelationships between seven large-scale brain networks were examined with network contingency analysis. Results: ADHD brains exhibited altered resting state connectivity between default network and ventral attention network [P < 0.0001, false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected], including prominent increased connectivity (more specifically, diminished anticorrelation) between posterior cingulate cortex in default network and right anterior insula and supplementary motor area in ventral attention network. There was distributed hypoconnectivity within default network (P = 0.009, FDR-corrected), and this network also exhibited significant alterations in its interconnections with several other large-scale networks. Additionally, there was pronounced right lateralization of aberrant default network connections. Conclusions: Consistent with existing theoretical models, these results provide evidence that default network-ventral attention network interconnections are a key locus of dysfunction in ADHD. Moreover, these findings contribute to growing evidence that distributed dysconnectivity within and between large-scale networks is present in ADHD.

Cleaning was found to affect negative, neutral, and mildly positive states. We extend this influence to success, a self-serving state. We manipulated success vs. failure and measured changes in optimism (Experiment 1) or self-esteem (Experiment 2). Moreover, we examined boundary conditions for the clean-slate effect. Experiment 1 indicates that the influence of performance on optimism diminishes if participants knew (compared to did not know) they were cleaning their hands. Experiment 2 indicates that the influence of performance on self-esteem diminishes if participants cleaned themselves (compared to an object). These results suggest that the clean-slate effect requires both awareness and self-reference of the cleaning act.

For example, traditional theories cannot account for refusals to cooperate if cooperation would result in higher payoffs. A prominent illustration are responders' rejections of positive but unequal payoffs in the Ultimatum Game. To accommodate this anomaly in a rational framework one needs to assume both a preference for higher payoffs and a preference for equal payoffs. The current set of studies shows that the relative weight of these preference components depends on external conditions and that consumption priming may decrease responders' rejections of unequal payoffs. Specifically, we demonstrate that increasing the accessibility of consumption-related information accentuates the preference for higher payoffs. Furthermore, consumption priming increased responders' reaction times for unequal payoffs which suggests an increased conflict between both preference components. While these results may also be integrated into existing social preference models, we try to identify some basic psychological processes underlying economic decision making. Going beyond the Ultimatum Game, we propose that a distinction between comparative and deductive evaluations may provide a more general framework to account for various anomalies in behavioral economics.","[Zuern, Michael] Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol Social & Econ Cognit 2, Cologne, Germany; [Strack, Fritz] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Wurzburg, Germany","Zurn, M (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol Social & Econ Cognit 2, Cologne, Germany.",michael.zuern@uni-koeln.de,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,48,0,0,1,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,NA,NA,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Both open-minded and caring are generally seen as positive attributes. However, consistency varies-the attribute caring is consistent with the midwife stereotype while open-minded is not. In general, both stimulus valence and consistency can influence evaluations. Six experiments investigated the respective influence of valence and consistency on evaluative judgments in the domain of stereotyping. In an impression formation paradigm, valence and consistency of stereotypic information about target persons were manipulated orthogonally and spontaneous evaluations of these target persons were measured. Valence reliably influenced evaluations. However, for strongly valenced stereotypes, no effect of consistency was observed. Parameters possibly preventing the occurrence of consistency effects were ruled out, specifically, valence of inconsistent attributes, processing priority of category information, and impression formation instructions. However, consistency had subtle effects on evaluative judgments if the information about a target person was not strongly valenced and experimental conditions were optimal. Concluding, in principle, both stereotype valence and consistency can play a role in evaluative judgments of stereotypic target persons. However, the more subtle influence of consistency does not seem to substantially influence evaluations of stereotyped target persons. Implications for fluency research and stereotype disconfirmation are discussed.","[Schubert, Lisa; Koerner, Anita; Strack, Fritz] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Psychol, Wurzburg, Germany; [Lindau, Berit; Topolinski, Sascha] Univ Cologne, Social Cognit Ctr Cologne, Cologne, Germany","Schubert, L (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Inst Psychol, Wurzburg, Germany.",lisa.schubert@uni-wuerzburg.de,NA,"Schubert, Lisa/0000-0001-9735-8786; Korner, Anita/0000-0003-3761-2118",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Str 264/25-1]; German Federal State Government of North-Rhine Westphalia (Nachwuchsforschun gsgruppe) [NRW 005-1503-0007],This research was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (Str 264/25-1) and by German Federal State Government of North-Rhine Westphalia (Nachwuchsforschun gsgruppe.

As a consequence, this information will be more likely to become the basis for the absolute judgment which will therefore be assimilated toward the anchor. However, if the activated information overlaps with information that is elicited by the absolute judgment itself, the preceding comparative judgment should not exert an incremental effect and should fail to result in an anchoring effect. The present studies find this result when the comparative judgment refers to a general category and the absolute judgment refers to a subset of the general category that was activated by the anchor value. For example, participants comparing the average annual temperature in New York City to a high 102 degrees F judged the average winter, but not summer temperature to be higher than participants making no comparison. On the other hand, participants comparing the annual temperature to a low -4 degrees F judged the average summer, but not winter temperature to be lower than control participants.

All these processes serve the ultimate function to increase processing depth and thus cognitively master the surprising stimulus. The present account introduces phasic negative affect as the underlying mechanism responsible for this switch in operating mode. Surprising stimuli are schema discrepant and thus entail cognitive disfluency, which elicits immediate negative affect. This affect in turn works like a phasic cognitive tuning switching the current processing mode from more automatic and heuristic to more systematic and reflective processing. Directly testing the initial elicitation of negative affect by surprising events, the present experiment presented high and low surprising neutral trivia statements to N = 28 participants while assessing their spontaneous facial expressions via facial electromyography. High compared to low surprising trivia elicited higher corrugator activity, indicative of negative affect and mental effort, while leaving zygomaticus (positive affect) and frontalis (cultural surprise expression) activity unaffected. Future research shall investigate the mediating role of negative affect in eliciting surprise-related outcomes.","[Topolinski, Sascha] Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol Social & Econ Cognit, Richard Strauss Str 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Strack, Fritz] Univ Wurzburg, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Topolinski, S (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol Social & Econ Cognit, Richard Strauss Str 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.",sascha.topolinski@uni-koeln.de,NA,NA,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Str 264/25-1],This research was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; Str 264/25-1).,NA,92,38,39,0,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,NA,NA,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

These critiques as well as failures to replicate several high-profile studies have been used as justification to proclaim a replication crisis in psychology. Psychologists are encouraged to conduct more exact replications of published studies to assess the reproducibility of psychological research. This article argues that the alleged crisis of replicability is primarily due to an epistemological misunderstanding that emphasizes the phenomenon instead of its underlying mechanisms. As a consequence, a replicated phenomenon may not serve as a rigorous test of a theoretical hypothesis because identical operationalizations of variables in studies conducted at different times and with different subject populations might test different theoretical constructs. Therefore, we propose that for meaningful replications, attempts at reinstating the original circumstances are not sufficient. Instead, replicators must ascertain that conditions are realized that reflect the theoretical variable(s) manipulated (and/or measured) in the original study.","[Stroebe, Wolfgang] Univ Utrecht, Dept Psychol, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Stroebe, Wolfgang] Univ Groningen, Dept Social & Org Psychol, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Strack, Fritz] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Wurzburg, Germany","Stroebe, W (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Psychol, POB 80140, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",w.stroebe@uu.nl,NA,"Stroebe, Wolfgang/0000-0003-2767-2838",NA,NA,NA,78,237,239,6,137,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1745-6916,1745-6924,NA,PERSPECT PSYCHOL SCI,Perspect.

According to the motivational priming theory, pain should facilitate the processing of unpleasant and hamper the processing of pleasant affective stimuli. To this end, we investigated the influence of tonic pain on the processing of happy and angry faces in 30 healthy participants. As a measure of affect processing, the interference of picture content on participants' voluntary reactions to the pictures either with a compatible or an incompatible facial muscle (M. zygomaticus major [smile] or M. corrugator supercilii [frown]) was recorded by electromyogram (EMG). Additionally, participants rated valence and arousal of each picture. During both tasks, the participants received either painful or non-painful pressure stimulation. Pain stimulation was generally associated with slower compatible and incompatible muscle responses (M. zygomaticus and M. corrugator) and fewer erroneous incompatible (M. corrugator) responses to happy faces. However, pain did not affect muscle responses to angry faces and explicit valence and arousal ratings. Thus, pain seems to selectively influence the responses to happy faces, which may result from a slowed processing of incongruent information (happy/pain). That happy faces are processed differently during pain may bear important implications for social interactions during acute and possibly even chronic pain states.

It was further predicted that the self should also be represented as belonging to larger units, and hence be more interdependent under approach than under avoidance. Study 2 supports this prediction. As a consequence of this focus on belonging to larger units, it was finally predicted that approach results in a stronger identification with one's in-group than avoidance.

A global processing style, in turn, is assumed to instigate a focus on similarities whereas a local processing style is assumed to instigate a focus on differences. Integrating these two ideas, the present research examines the hypothesis that participants under approach perceive objects as more similar to each other than participants under avoidance. To test this assumption, we induced the two motivational orientations and elicited judgments of similarities (Experiments 1 and 2) and differences (Experiment 2) for pairs of pictures. Results confirmed the hypothesis. We propose that the relative attunement to similarities/differences under approach/avoidance is functional because it allows for a flexible conceptualization of the environment/an ability to discern slight deviations from what is expected.

Modern psychology has tackled the self-control problem from a variety of perspectives, such as cybernetic models, models of inter-temporal choice, goal-intention models, goal-conflict models, and dual-system models. One advantage of dual-system models seems to be that these models explicitly integrate impulsive processes of behavior determination into their theoretical architecture.

As a consequence. blocking such pronunciation simulations through a secondary oral motor task decreased the false-fame effect for repeatedly presented names of actors (Experiment I) as well as prevented increases in trust due to repetition for brand names and names of shares in the stock market (Experiment 2) Extending this evidence beyond repeated exposure, we demonstrated that blocking oral motor simulations also prevented fluency effects of word pronunciation on judgments of hazardousness (Experiment 3) Concerning the realm of judgment correction, this procedural blocking of (biasing) associative processes is a decontamination method not considered before in the literature. because it is independent of exposure control, mood, motivation, and post hoc correction strategies The present results also have implications for applied issues, such as advertising and investment decisions","[Topolinski, Sascha; Strack, Fritz] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Topolinski, S (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol 2, Roentgenring 10, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,163,56,56,0,37,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,NA,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

Design and participants Forty-two hazardous drinkers were assigned randomly to a condition in which they were implicitly trained to avoid or to approach alcohol, using a training variety of the alcohol Approach Avoidance Test (AAT). Participants pushed or pulled a joystick in response to picture-format (landscape or portrait). The pictures depicted alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks. Participants in the avoid-alcohol condition pushed most alcoholic and pulled most non-alcoholic drinks. For participants in the approach-alcohol condition these contingencies were reversed. After the implicit training, participants performed a taste test, including beers and soft drinks. Automatic action tendencies at post-test were assessed with the AAT, including both trained and untrained pictures, and with a different test (Implicit Association Test, IAT). We further tested effects on subjective craving. Results Action tendencies for alcohol changed in accordance with training condition, with the largest effects in the clinically relevant avoid-alcohol condition. These effects occurred outside subjective awareness and generalized to new pictures in the AAT and to an entirely different test using words, rather than pictures (IAT). In relatively heavy drinking participants who demonstrated changed action tendencies in accordance with their training condition, effects were found on drinking behaviour, with participants in the approach-alcohol condition drinking more alcohol than participants in the avoid-alcohol condition. No effect was found on subjective craving. Conclusions Retraining automatic processes may help to regain control over addictive impulses, which points to new treatment possibilities.","[Wiers, Reinout W.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Rinck, Mike] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Behav Sci, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Kordts, Robert; Strack, Fritz] Univ Wurzburg, LS Psychol II, Wurzburg, Germany; [Houben, Katrijn] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands","Wiers, RW (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, Roetersstr 15, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",r.wiers@uva.nl,"Rinck, Mike/A-6944-2010; Wiers, Reinout/AAB-4008-2021","Wiers, Reinout/0000-0002-4312-9766",NWO-VidiNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [45202005],"This research was supported by supported by NWO-Vidi grant 45202005 awarded to the first author.

The first prediction was confirmed in two studies where participants rated how psychologically similar persons depicted on photos were to themselves.

These intuitions are driven by increased fluency in processing coherent triads compared to incoherent triads, which in turn triggers a brief and short positive affect. The present work investigates which of these internal cues, fluency or positive affect, is the actual cue underlying coherence intuitions. In Experiment 1, participants liked coherent word triads more than incoherent triads, but did not rate them as being more fluent in processing. In Experiment 2, participants could intuitively detect coherence when they misattributed fluency to an external source, but lost this intuitive ability when they misattributed affect. It is concluded that the coherence-induced fluency by itself is not consciously experienced and not used in the coherence intuitions, but the fluency-triggered affective consequences.

In line with this account, it was shown that coherent triads (a) are processed faster than incoherent triads (Study 1), (b) serve as positive affective primes (Study 2), and (c) are liked more than incoherent triads (Study 3). When participants were provided with an irrelevant source of their affective reactions, they lost the ability to intuitively discriminate between coherent and incoherent triads (Study 4).

Under these two conditions, this strategy leads to a confident rejection. However, if the distractor item is not judged as particularly memorable, alternative inferential strategies will be used, and with less confidence. These predictions were supported by two studies in which the memorability of words was varied by their salience and in which a ''presuppositional strategy'' was offered that allowed subjects to infer the occurrence of an event from the use of the definite article contained in queries.

According to these rules, contributions to a communication should be informative, relevant, true, and unambiguous. It is assumed that subjects determine the pragmatic meaning of instructions and questions on the basis of these rules and the provided context. In contrast to most natural settings, standardized experimental procedures rarely allow for an interactive determination of pragmatic meaning and often preclude feedback as a corrective device. As a consequence, subjects are required to rely heavily on general rules, and even subtle cues may become informationally loaded. The information extracted from context cues may often not be intended by the experimenter. Thus subjects may infer more than they are supposed to, resulting in discrepancies between the experimenter's intended and subjects' inferred meaning of the instructions. If researchers are not sensitive to the information provided by verbal and non-verbal context cues, their interpretation of research results may be based on biased data. Evidence from different research domains is reported to support the presented assumptions and their implications for bias avoiding strategies are discussed.","UNIV MANNHEIM, W-6800 MANNHEIM, GERMANY; UNIV TRIER, W-5500 TRIER, GERMANY; ZUMA, MANNHEIM, GERMANY",NA,NA,"Schwarz, Norbert/B-3591-2008","Schwarz, Norbert/0000-0002-8868-7067",NA,NA,NA,58,60,60,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-2772,1099-0992,NA,EUR J SOC PSYCHOL,Eur.

Study 1 results revealed that success at an achievement task led to greater feelings of pride if the outcome was received in an upright position rather than in a slumped posture. Study 2 results revealed that nonemotional feelings of effort were influenced by contraction of the forehead muscle (corrugator), and Ss' self-ratings on a trait dimension reflected this experience when the facial contraction was maintained during the recall of behavioral episodes exemplifying this trait. To account for these results, a framework is proposed that draws on a distinction between noetic and experiential representations","UNIV TRIER,FBI PSYCHOL,POSTFACH 3825,W-5500 TRIER,GERMANY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,62,320,330,0,56,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242",0022-3514,NA,NA,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

In a previous phase of the study that was ostensibly unrelated to the judgment task, the relevant trait categories were primed. Subsequently, half of the subjects were reminded of the priming episode. Consistent with earlier research (e.g. Lombardi, Higgins and Bargh, 1987, Newman and Uleman, 1990) that used memory of the priming events as a correlational measure, a contrast effect was found under the 'reminding' condition and assimilation resulted when subjects were not reminded of the priming episode. This pattern of results is interpreted as the consequence of corrective influences.","UNIV MANNHEIM,W-6800 MANNHEIM,GERMANY","STRACK, F (corresponding author), UNIV TRIER,FBI PSYCHOL,POSTFACH 3825,W-5500 TRIER,GERMANY.",NA,"Schwarz, Norbert/B-3591-2008","Schwarz, Norbert/0000-0002-8868-7067",NA,NA,NA,27,204,205,1,21,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,W SUSSEX,"BAFFINS LANE CHICHESTER, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND PO19 1UD",0046-2772,NA,NA,EUR J SOC PSYCHOL,Eur.

The application of these stereotypes, however, depends on conditions like mood at the time a judgment is made. The present study investigated the influence of mood on the application of stereotypes about West Germans versus East Germans. Subjects in good or bad mood had to play the role of a personnel manager whose task was to judge the suitability of a western or eastern candidate for a management position. To simplify their judgment, subjects in good mood were expected to apply the stereotypes <<East>> and <<West>> and so devaluate the eastern candidate. In bad mood, systematic information processing should lead to a positive evaluation of the eastern candidate because he has a good qualification despite professional handicaps. These hypotheses were confirmed: In good mood subjects preferred the western candidate whereas in bad mood a preference for the eastern candidate tended to emerge.",NA,"STEPPER, S (corresponding author), UNIV TRIER,FB SOZIAL PSYCHOL,D-54286 TRIER,GERMANY.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24,4,4,0,4,VERLAG HANS HUBER,BERN 9,"LANGGASS-STRASSE 76, CH-3000 BERN 9, SWITZERLAND",0044-3514,NA,NA,Z SOZIALPSYCHOL,Z.

Subjects read a story to which either understanding or anger was a possible reaction. While reading the story, all subjects were induced to hold their faces in expressions of either happiness or anger In addition, one group of subjects engaged in 2 min of vigorous exercise immediately before reading the story. Another group engaged in the exercise 90 s before reading the story. The control group read the story without having exercised. Non-aroused subjects tended to report more favorable reactions when smiling than when holding an angry expression. This difference was significant when there was a delay between the exercise and the rating task and was reduced to nonsignificance when there was no delay. These results are discussed in the context of a theory of private self-perception in which people use their bodily sensations as information when making judgments.","MAX PLANCK INST PSYCHOL RES,MUNICH,GERMANY","MARTIN, LL (corresponding author), UNIV GEORGIA,DEPT PSYCHOL,ATHENS,GA 30602, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25,37,37,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320",0146-1672,NA,NA,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

Competing hypotheses about mood influences on this correction process were tested in a laboratory experiment. While some models (e.g., Ellis & Ashbrook, 1988) predict a general reduction of capacity due to affect, another approach (Schwarz, 1990) suggests an informative function of mood which has an impact on processing style. Accordingly, good mood triggers a simplifying way of information processing, while bad mood evokes detail-oriented processing. Results of a 3 (mood: positive, negative, neutral)X2 (target behaviour: happy, sad)X2 (situation: congruent, incongruent) experiment show that, for judgments about the target person's temperament, only observers in a neutral mood took into account situational information, while those in either a good or a bad mood did not. For judgments about the target's social attractiveness, however, which were more self-relevant, it was shown that observers in a bad mood did consider situational information, while those in either a good or a neutral mood did not. As no differences in recall were obtained, it is concluded that situational information is available independent of mood. If it enters into the judgment process, however, is determined by the personal relevance of the judgment and the informative function of the affective state.","UNIV TRIER, W-5500 TRIER, GERMANY; ZENTRUM UMFRAGEN METHODEN & ANALYSEN EV, MANNHEIM, GERMANY","BOHNER, G (corresponding author), UNIV MANNHEIM, FP SUBJEK ERFAHRUNG, STEUBENSTR 46, W-6800 MANNHEIM, GERMANY.",NA,"Schwarz, Norbert/B-3591-2008; Bohner, Gerd/B-2274-2008","Schwarz, Norbert/0000-0002-8868-7067; Bohner, Gerd/0000-0002-0564-3625",NA,NA,NA,34,1,1,0,1,VERLAG HANS HUBER,BERN 9,"LANGGASS-STRASSE 76, CH-3000 BERN 9, SWITZERLAND",0044-3514,NA,NA,Z SOZIALPSYCHOL,Z.

Replication attempts like this one are clearly valuable and will continue to inform our science. We discuss a number of lessons we have taken from the process related to the divide between direct and conceptual replication, and whether the data can inform our current theory regarding the original effect. In discussing these issues, we advocate for transparent flexibility in data analyses and the involvement of the original authors at every stage of the process.","[Ferguson, Melissa J.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Carter, Travis J.; Hassin, Ran R.] Colby Coll, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel","Ferguson, MJ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Psychol, 230 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",MJF44@cornell.edu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,6,6,1,7,HOGREFE & HUBER PUBLISHERS,GOTTINGEN,"ROHNSWEG 25, D-37085 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY",1864-9335,2151-2590,NA,SOC PSYCHOL-GERMANY,Soc.

We suggest that when wanting and uncertainty are high and personal control is lacking, people may be more likely to help others, as if they can encourage fate's favor by doing good deeds proactively. Four experiments support this karmic-investment hypothesis. When people want an outcome over which they have little control, their donations of time and money increase (Experiments 1 and 2), but their participation in other rewarding activities does not (Experiment 1b).

Previous research (Carter & Gilovich, 2010; Van Boven & Gilovich, 2003) indicates that experiences, such as vacations and concerts, are more likely to do so than material possessions, such as clothes and electronic gadgets. The present research was designed to explore 1 potential explanation for this result, namely, that experiences tend to be more closely associated with the self than possessions. The authors first show that people tend to think of their experiential purchases as more connected to the self than their possessions. Compared with their material purchases, participants drew their experiential purchases physically closer to the self (Study 1), were more likely to mention them when telling their life story (Study 2), and felt that a purchase described in terms of its experiential, rather than its material, qualities would overlap more with their sense of who they are (Study 4). Participants also felt that knowing a person's experiential purchases, compared with their material purchases, would yield greater insight into that person's true self (Studies 3A-3C). The authors then show that the tendency to cling more closely to cherished experiential memories is connected to the greater satisfaction people derive from experiences than possessions (Study 5).","[Carter, Travis J.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Ctr Decis Res, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gilovich, Thomas] Cornell Univ, Dept Psychol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Carter, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Ctr Decis Res, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",Travis.Carter@ChicagoBooth.edu,NA,"Carter, Travis/0000-0003-4499-7300",NA,NA,NA,65,145,152,18,443,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0022-3514,1939-1315,NA,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

As much as Americans may love their country and way of life, they do not always explicitly agree with the policies that best serve to bolster and perpetuate the nation, such as unyielding diplomatic stances, unilateral military action, or giving up civil liberties in exchange for security. How then does a country with such diverse explicit opinions maintain its national power structures and the support of the populace? System justification theory contends that members of a system have an implicit motive to justify and bolster that system (Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004). Based on recent work on the implicit nationalism, we argue that the types of information that become associated with the nation in memory are the same types of information that help bolster and perpetuate the American system. In the present study, we find that a subtle reminder of America increases system justification for those with some moderate exposure to the political media, regardless of their explicit ideology. We argue that the implicit activation of information associated with America ultimately serves a nationalistic function, and more broadly, the system justification motive.","[Carter, Travis J.; Ferguson, Melissa J.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Hassin, Ran R.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel","Carter, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Ctr Decis Res, Harper Ctr C74, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",Travis.Carter@ChicagoBooth.edu,NA,"Carter, Travis/0000-0003-4499-7300",NA,NA,NA,69,19,19,0,12,GUILFORD PUBLICATIONS INC,NEW YORK,"370 SEVENTH AVE, SUITE 1200, NEW YORK, NY 10001-1020 USA",0278-016X,NA,NA,SOC COGNITION,Soc.

We propose that the evaluation of experiences tends to be less comparative than that of material possessions, such that potentially invidious comparisons have less impact on satisfaction with experiences than with material possessions. Support for this contention was obtained in 8 studies. We found that participants were less satisfied with their material purchases because they were more likely to ruminate about unchosen options (Study 1); that participants tended to maximize when selecting material goods and satisfice when selecting experiences (Study 2); that participants examined unchosen material purchases more than unchosen experiential purchases (Study 3); and that, relative to experiences, participants' satisfaction with their material possessions was undermined more by comparisons to other available options (Studies 4 and 5A), to the same option at a different price (Studies 5B and 6), and to the purchases of other individuals (Study 5C).

A series of studies provided robust evidence for our hypothesis. Lawyers. university students, and MTurk and Prolific participants said that they would have underreported extremely favorable outcomes in real-world scenarios (Studies 1a-1d). They did so to avoid appearing dishonest. Furthermore, in a novel behavioral paradigm involving a chance game with monetary prizes, participants who received in private a very large number of wins reported fewer wins than they received; they lied and incurred a monetary cost to avoid looking like liars (Studies 2a-2c).

In this Article, we show that the opposite is also true information about punishment can influence the extent to which an act of wrongdoing is judged to have been harmful.

However, the precise developmental profile of such a shift is still subject to debate. This study sought to determine the age at which the perceived intentions of others begin to influence fairness-related decision making in children (aged 6-8 and 9-11 years) and adolescents (aged 14 and 15 years) in the context of the mini-ultimatum game. The mini-ultimatum game has a forced-choice design, whereby a proposer needs to select one of two predetermined offers that a responder can either accept or reject. Due to these constraints, the procedure measures sensitivity to unfair intentions in addition to unfair outcomes. Participants needed to make judgments about how likely they would be to reject various offers, how fair they judged these offers to be, and the emotion they experienced when thinking about the offers. Contrary to previous published reports, we found that even 6- to 8-year-olds employed a sophisticated notion of fairness that took into account the alternatives the proposer had available. Crucially, decision making did not differ as a function of age. A further, and novel, aim was to trace the developmental origins of temporal asymmetries in judgments ab out fairness by testing the implications of adopting a past or future temporal perspective. Across all ages, we found no evidence that fairness-based decision making varies as a function of temporal location. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We examined whether children showed a similar bias, and whether there were any developmental changes in the magnitude of such a bias. Children aged 6-7 and 9-10 years, adolescents, and adults completed two tasks in which they could report either past or future thoughts: a mind-wandering task assessing spontaneous past and future thinking and a cued episodic thinking task in which they were free to describe either past or future events. Only adults showed a future-oriented bias in the mind-wandering task. Participants in all groups were much more likely to describe past events in the cue word task, and the proportion of future events described did not change developmentally. However, more than a third of the youngest age group produced no descriptions at all of future events, which was a significantly larger proportion than in any other age groups, and illustrates the difficulty that some children of this age have with future thinking. Our findings indicate that future-oriented bias and developmental changes in such bias may be task-specific.","[McCormack, Teresa; Burns, Patrick; O'Connor, Patrick] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Psychol, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Jaroslawska, Agnieszka] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Philosophy Psychol & Language Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Caruso, Eugene M.] UCLA, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA USA","McCormack, T (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Psychol, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.",t.mccormack@qub.ac.uk,NA,"O'Connor, Patrick Aaron/0000-0003-0936-0478; Jaroslawska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-1358-7512; Burns, Patrick/0000-0002-1735-1910","Economic and Social Sciences Research Council, UK [ES/N000900/1]","This research was supported by a research grant from the Economic and Social Sciences Research Council, UK, Grant No. ES/N000900/1.",NA,72,4,4,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0340-0727,1430-2772,NA,PSYCHOL RES-PSYCH FO,Psychol.

For example, participants' envy in February rose as Valentine's Day approached (as a peer's enviable date loomed in the future) but abruptly plateaued come February 15 onward (after the date occurred). Further, the passing of time specifically assuaged the pain of comparison (whereas positive reactions, such as feeling inspired, remained high; Studies 3a, 3b, and 3c); therefore, taking a past perspective can be used to regulate negative emotions in the present (Study 4). Time asymmetrically shapes the experience of upward comparison, despite other people's desirable outcomes indeed being achieved.

Eight experiments (N = 2,119) reveal that body cam video of an incident results in lower observer judgments of intentionality than dash cam video of the same incident, an effect documented with both scripted videos and real police videos. This effect was due, in part, to variation in the visual salience of the focal actor: the body cam wearer is typically less visually salient when depicted in body versus dash cam video, which corresponds with lower observer intentionality judgments. In showing how visual salience of the focal actor may introduce unique effects on observer judgment, this research establishes an empirical platform that may inform public policy regarding surveillance of police conduct.","[Turner, Broderick L.; Roese, Neal J.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Caruso, Eugene M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Dilich, Mike A.] Foresight Reconstruct Inc, Morton Grove, IL 60053 USA","Turner, BL (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",broderick.turner@kellogg.northwestern.edu,"Turner, Broderick/AAB-1048-2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,21,8,8,1,8,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,NA,NA,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

The fear of creating such dissatisfaction may cause leaders in organizations to waste resources that cannot be allocated equally between their workers. Here we explore the effectiveness of a procedure designed to reduce such waste by empowering workers with the agency to decide whether or not to pay other workers more. We predict that workers' sense of agency reduces their dissatisfaction with others' better outcomes. Seven studies supported this prediction by demonstrating that agentic participants, who were involved in creating allocations, tended to be more satisfied with others' better outcomes than nonagentic participants, who were not involved in creating allocations. Longitudinal lab studies, measuring real behavior, showed that agentic participants remained more satisfied than nonagentic ones even five weeks after their initial decision. The findings provided evidence for two mechanisms underlying the effect: increased feelings of generosity, and reduced perception of unfairness. We found that the agency procedure was comparable with other fair procedures in its ability to improve worker satisfaction. We discuss our findings in relation to the literatures on social preference, fairness, and voice, and highlight the implications for organizational efficiency.","[Choshen-Hillel, Shoham] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Business Adm, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel; [Choshen-Hillel, Shoham] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Federmann Ctr Study Rat, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel; [Shaw, Alex] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Caruso, Eugene M.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Choshen-Hillel, S (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Business Adm, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel.; Choshen-Hillel, S (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Federmann Ctr Study Rat, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel.",shoham@huji.ac.il,NA,"Choshen-Hillel, Shoham/0000-0002-3219-2751",Social Enterprise Initiative at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business,"This work was partially supported by a research grant from the Social Enterprise Initiative at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

Eight studies reveal that abdicating a resource allocation decision-that is, giving away one's right to choose to someone else-may allow these two rewards to work in tandem. We found that people frequently abdicated to others, and abdication often prompted others to reciprocate by giving away the better of two items. This occurred in part because people perceived abdication to be generous; in fact, individuals who abdicated seemed nearly as generous as individuals who gave away the better item to begin with. Paradoxically, abdicating confers both the reputational benefits of giving and (often) the material benefits of getting.

Although such efforts to avoid appearing partial can often reduce biases, we argue that, at times, such efforts can actually lead people to be biased against their friends. We theorize that people do so because they recognize that benefitting their friends may be viewed by others as partial. This argument makes two key predictions, which we investigated in eight studies using workplace scenarios. First, we predicted and found that, when the decision was public, allocators were reluctant to give a bonus to a deserving employee when that employee was a friend rather than a non-friend. In private, however, participants were willing to give the bonus to the deserving person whether she was a friend or a non-friend, suggesting that their public behavior was aimed at avoiding the appearance of bias. Second, we predicted and found that allocators' reluctance to give a bonus to a deserving friend is mediated by their beliefs that others would find this behavior to be unfair.

Across three field studies, we randomly assigned participants to view an appeal for a charitable organization that emphasized agency (the pursuit of personal goals) or communion (the pursuit of shared goals). When the appeal emphasized agency, wealthier individuals reported greater willingness to give and donated more money to charity. In contrast, when the appeal emphasized communion, less wealthy individuals reported greater willingness to give. These findings could not be explained by relevant demographic characteristics such as age, ethnicity, or gender.

In courtrooms and popular media, such inferences increasingly rely on video evidence, which is often played in slow motion. Four experiments (n = 1,610) involving real surveillance footage from a murder or broadcast replays of violent contact in professional football demonstrate that viewing an action in slow motion, compared with regular speed, can cause viewers to perceive an action as more intentional. This slow motion intentionality bias occurred, in part, because slow motion video caused participants to feel like the actor had more time to act, even when they knew how much clock time had actually elapsed. Four additional experiments (n = 2,737) reveal that allowing viewers to see both regular speed and slow motion replay mitigates the bias, but does not eliminate it. We conclude that an empirical understanding of the effect of slow motion on mental state attribution should inform the life-or-death decisions that are currently based on tacit assumptions about the objectivity of human perception.","[Caruso, Eugene M.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Burns, Zachary C.] Univ San Francisco, Sch Management, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA; [Converse, Benjamin A.] Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Frank Batten Sch Leadership & Publ Policy, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Caruso, EM (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",ecaruso@chicagobooth.edu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,13,17,17,0,3,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,NA,NA,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Therefore, we predicted that over-claiming would increase with group size because larger groups leave more contributions from others to overlook. In 2 field studies, participants claimed more responsibility as the number of academic authors per article and the number of MBA students per study group increased. As predicted by our theoretical account, this over-claiming bias was reduced when group members considered others' contributions explicitly. Two experiments that directly manipulated group size replicated these results.

Why do events sometimes seem closeyet other times seem ages away?We propose a tripartite model of the foundations of psychological distance in which: (a) people use spatial distance as a metaphor for psychological distance; (b) the ecology of subjective experiences that coincide with changes in objective distance define, and hence, influence psychological distance; (c) psychological distance is shaped in the service of people's ultimate goals, or teleological considerations, of successfully navigating through time. This model implies that the subjective experiences that are typically associated with reductions in objective temporal distance should reduce temporal psychological distance-the subjective sense of how close or far away events are. We review evidence indicating that emotional arousal, attention, fluency, and motivational considerations all reduce psychological distance. This model also implies a temporal asymmetry in which people prioritize thinking about the future, which approaches in time, over thinking about the past, which recedes in time. Consequently, the future is psychologically closer than the past, people attend more to the future than to the past, and people feel more emotionally aroused about the future than about the past.

When these two principles conflict with one another, people will often waste resources to avoid inequity. We suggest that people wish to avoid inequity not because they find it inherently unfair, but because they want to avoid the appearance of partiality associated with it. We explore one way to reduce waste by reducing the perceived partiality of inequitable allocations. Specifically, we hypothesize that people will be more likely to favor an efficient (albeit inequitable) allocation if it puts them in a disadvantaged position than if it puts others in a disadvantaged position. To test this hypothesis, we asked participants to choose between giving some extra resource to one person (thereby creating inequity between this person and equally deserving others) and not giving the resource to anyone (thereby wasting the resource). Six studies, using realistic scenarios and behavioral paradigms, provide robust evidence for a self-disadvantaging effect: Allocators were consistently more likely to create inequity to avoid wasting resources when the resulting inequity would put them at a relative disadvantage than when it would put others at a relative disadvantage. We further find that this self-disadvantaging effect is a direct result of people's concern about appearing partial. Our findings suggest the importance of impartiality even in distributive justice, thereby bridging a gap between the distributive and procedural justice literatures.","[Choshen-Hillel, Shoham; Shaw, Alex; Caruso, Eugene M.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Choshen-Hillel, S (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem Sch Business Adm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",shoham.choshen@mail.huji.ac.il,NA,"Choshen-Hillel, Shoham/0000-0002-3219-2751",Willard Graham Faculty Research Fund at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business; John Templeton Foundation,"This work is supported by the Willard Graham Faculty Research Fund at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

Four studies demonstrate a systematic asymmetry whereby future events are psychologically closer than past events of equivalent objective distance. When considering specific times (e.g., 1 year) or events (e.g., Valentine's Day), people consistently reported that the future was closer than the past. We suggest that this asymmetry arises because the subjective experience of movement through time (whereby future events approach and past events recede) is analogous to the physical experience of movement through space. Consistent with this hypothesis, experimentally reversing the metaphorical arrow of time (by having participants move backward through virtual space) completely eliminated the past-future asymmetry.

These contradictory intuitions can be partly explained by considering the perceived intentionality of the agent generating the streak. The intuition that streaks will continue (reverse) should emerge in contexts involving agents that are perceived to be intentional (unintentional), and should be most common among those who are most inclined to attribute intentions to other agents. Four studies support these predictions, identifying both situational and dispositional determinants of the perceived continuity of streaks. Discussion focuses on the foundational nature of intentionality for perceptions of interdependence between events, the relationship between these findings and existing theoretical accounts, and the inverse possibility that people use perceptions of streakiness as a cue for an agent's intentionality.

In this article, we demonstrate that political partisanship influences people's visual representations of a biracial political candidate's skin tone. In three studies, participants rated the representativeness of photographs of a hypothetical (Study 1) or real (Barack Obama; Studies 2 and 3) biracial political candidate. Unbeknownst to participants, some of the photographs had been altered to make the candidate's skin tone either lighter or darker than it was in the original photograph. Participants whose partisanship matched that of the candidate they were evaluating consistently rated the lightened photographs as more representative of the candidate than the darkened photographs, whereas participants whose partisanship did not match that of the candidate showed the opposite pattern. For evaluations of Barack Obama, the extent to which people rated lightened photographs as representative of him was positively correlated with their stated voting intentions and reported voting behavior in the 2008 Presidential election. This effect persisted when controlling for political ideology and racial attitudes. These results suggest that people's visual representations of others are related to their own preexisting beliefs and to the decisions they make in a consequential context.","[Caruso, Eugene M.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Mead, Nicole L.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Mkt, Tilburg Inst Behav Econ Res, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Balcetis, Emily] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA","Caruso, EM (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",ecaruso@chicagobooth.edu,"Mead, Nicole/L-7675-2019; Mead, Nicole/Q-7856-2016","Mead, Nicole/0000-0002-9621-4999",The University of Chicago Booth School of BusinessUniversity of Chicago; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of CanadaSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),"We thank Ashley Angulo, Brittani Baxter, Noah Goldstein, Jasmine Kwong, Brooke Lerner, Matt Liebert, and Jennifer Omoregie for their assistance in executing these experiments, and Mahzarin Banaji, Heather Caruso, Joshua Correll, Jane Risen, Jay Van Bavel, and members of our various laboratory groups and research workshops for their insightful comments on this work.

The authors propose that duration insensitivity occurs when stimuli are evaluated in isolation because they typically lack comparison information. People should be able to evaluate the duration Of Stimuli in isolation, however, when stimuli are familiar and evoke comparison information. The results of 3 experiments support the hypothesis. Participants were insensitive to the duration of hypothetical (Experiment 1) and real (Experiment 2) unfamiliar experiences but sensitive to the duration of familiar experiences. In Experiment 3, participants were insensitive to the duration of an unfamiliar noise when it was unlabeled but sensitive to its duration when it was given a familiar label (i.e., a telephone ring). Rather than being a unique phenomenon, duration neglect (and perhaps other forms of scope insensitivity) appears to be a particular case of insensitivity to unfamiliar attributes.","[Morewedge, Carey K.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Kassam, Karim S.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hsee, Christopher K.; Caruso, Eugene M.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Morewedge, CK (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, 208 Porter Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",morewedge@cmu.edu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,45,20,20,0,14,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0096-3445,1939-2222,NA,J EXP PSYCHOL GEN,J.

We asked 101 students to make a series of choices between prospective teammates in a trivia contest who varied on three dimensions relevant to the decisions (education, IQ, experience) and one dimension that was irrelevant (body weight). Although participants stated explicitly that weight had little impact on their decisions, weight actually accounted for more than 25% of the variance in their revealed preferences. Additional analyses demonstrated that participants gave up about I I IQ points to have a thin rather than overweight teammate. We suggest that conjoint analysis can be a valuable tool for detecting and quantifying the social costs of covert attitudes that are not in sync with overt values.","[Caruso, Eugene M.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Rahnev, Dobromir] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychology, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Banaji, Mahzarin R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Caruso, EM (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",ecaruso@chicagogsb.edu,"Rahnev, Dobromir/AAC-4506-2019","Rahnev, Dobromir/0000-0002-5265-2559",NA,NA,NA,24,67,66,0,9,GUILFORD PUBLICATIONS INC,NEW YORK,"370 SEVENTH AVE, SUITE 1200, NEW YORK, NY 10001-1020 USA",0278-016X,NA,NA,SOC COGNITION,Soc.

Whether people imagined being compensated or compensating others, they required and offered more compensation for events that would take place in the future than for identical events that had taken place in the past. This temporal value asymmetry (TVA) was robust in between-persons comparisons and absent in within-persons comparisons, which suggests that participants considered the TVA irrational. Contemplating future events produced greater affect than did contemplating past events, and this difference mediated the TVA. We suggest that the TVA, the gain-loss asymmetry, and hyperbolic time discounting can be unified in a three-dimensional value function that describes how people value gains and losses of different magnitudes at different moments in time.","[Caruso, Eugene M.] Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gilbert, Daniel T.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wilson, Timothy D.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Caruso, EM (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",ecaruso@chicagogsb.edu; gilbert@wjh.harvard.edu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25,92,96,1,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,NA,NA,PSYCHOL SCI,Psychol.

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 61, 195-202). Four studies demonstrate that people rely relatively more on the experienced case of recall when making judgments about the self compared to judgments about others. This pattern was found for judgments of an average (Study I a) or specific (Study 1b) other. Subjective retrieval ease was less informative when people were relatively less familiar with the specific other person. Providing an alternative explanation for the experienced difficulty of recall affected self, but not social, assessments (Study 2). In addition, the effect generalized to risk judgments about a state of the world; namely, the safety of one's town (Study 3). A deeper appreciation of when and why people rely on different sources of accessible information when making judgments may help in understanding and reducing social conflict. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
