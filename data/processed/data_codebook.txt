Project title: Post-replication citation patterns in psychology: Four case studies

This codebook documents four datasets each of which is stored in .csv format (for maximum interoperability) and .rds format (for maximum efficiency and reproducibility for R users). Each dataset is described in more detail below.

# Dataset 1: d_citations

Description: This dataset contains bibliographic records for all articles that cite each of the five original articles (Baumeister, Strack, Sripada, Caruso, Carter) from the publication date of each original study through to 31st December, 2019. The dataset has one row per article.

Source: The records were downloaded from Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection accessed via the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin on 12th August, 2020. The following steps were followed:

1. Go to Web of Science (https://wok.mimas.ac.uk/) and log in
2. Search the Web of Science Core Collection for the target article.
3. On the right hand side next to the article record it should say "Times Cited". Click on the number which should be a hyperlink. This should now display records for all of the citing articles.
4. To export the records, use the "Export to" button and choose "Fast 5K"

Columns:

Most of the columns the in the datasets refer to Web of Science field codes and many of them are irrelevant to the current project. Some columns were added by T.E.H. Details for each column below.

PT = Publication Type (J=Journal; B=Book; S=Series; P=Patent)
Disambiguate = a column added to help us tell the difference between articles that shared the same authors and publication year. For most articles this was not required so the column reads NA. For disambiguated articles there will be a letter (e.g., 'a' or 'b') in this column.
AU = Authors
BA = Book Authors
CA = Group Authors
GP = Book Group Authors
OI = ORCID Identifier (Open Researcher and Contributor ID)
BE = Editors
TI = Document Title
X1/Y1/Z1/FT/PN/AE/Z3 = Empty/unknown
SO = Publication Name
S1 = = Empty/unknown
SE = Book Series Title
BS = Book Series Subtitle
VL = Volume
IS = Issue
SI = Special Issue
MA = Meeting Abstract
BP = Beginning Page
EP = Ending Page
AR = Article Number
DI = Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
D2 = Book Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
SU = Supplement
PD = Publication Date
PY = Year Published
AB = Abstract
X4/Y4/Z4/AK/CT/CY/SP/CL = Empty/unknown
TC = Web of Science Core Collection Times Cited Count
Z8/ZB/ZS/Z9/SN/BN = Empty/unknown
UT = Accession Number
PM = PubMed ID
case = column added by T.E.H. to identify the case (i.e., Baumeister, Strack, Sripada, Caruso, Carter)
pubYear = Year Published (same as PY)

# Dataset 2: d_reference

Description: This dataset contains annual citations for all of the five original articles (Baumeister, Strack, Sripada, Caruso, Carter) from the publication year through to 2019. The dataset has one row per article.

Source: This information was downloaded from Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection accessed via the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin on 12th August, 2020.

The following steps were followed:

1. Go to Web of Science (https://wok.mimas.ac.uk/) and log in
2. Search with the journal name as publication name and the year of publication as the target article. This provides a list of all articles published in the same journal and years as the target article.
3. Click on 'Create Citation Report', scroll down to the bottom of the page, and choose export as excel file.
4. In the excel file, at the bottom, there is a list of all of the articles and the number of citations they received each year. Sum these columns to get the yearly citations to all articles. 

Columns:

year / pubYear = year to which 'totalCitations' refers
totalCitations = total citations to the original article identified in 'case' in the year identified in 'year'
case = identity of the original article (Baumeister, Strack, Sripada, Caruso, Carter)

# Dataset 3: d_contentAnalysis

Description: This dataset contains information created during the qualitative analyses, including citation valence, whether articles citing the original study also cited the replication, presence of counter arguments, and categorization of counter arguments. The dataset has one row per article.

Source: Some bibliographic information (doi, authors, pubYear, UT) is copied from d_citations. The other information was generated by the research team during the qualitative analyses.

Columns:

firstCoder = initials of the primary coder (see article author list)
secondCoder = initials of the secondary coder (see article author list)	
doi = Digital Object Idenitifier
authors = article authors 
pubYear = article publication year
excluded	= was this article excluded from qualitative analyses (TRUE or FALSE)?
exclusionReason = if the article was excluded, what was the reason?	
articleType = classification of the articles type by primary coder
citesReplication	= does the article cite the replication study in this case (TRUE or FALSE)?
citationClassificationOriginal = classification of citation valence by the primary coder
citationClassificationAgreed = classification of citation valence agreed upon by primary and secondary coder (and third coder if necessary)	
counterArguments = were explicit counter arguments found in the article (TRUE or FALSE)? (coded by SC and ORA)	
evidenceCounter = were any counter arguments in the 'evidence' category (TRUE or FALSE)? (coded by SC, ORA, & TEH)	 
evidenceVerbatim	= verbatim quote(s) from article that justify it belonging to this category
methodsCounter = were any counter arguments in the 'methodological differences and moderators' category (TRUE or FALSE)? (coded by SC, ORA, & TEH)	 
methodsVerbatim = verbatim quote(s) from article that justify it belonging to this category
expertiseCounter = were any counter arguments in the 'expertise' category (TRUE or FALSE)? (coded by SC, ORA, & TEH)	
expertiseVerbatim = verbatim quote(s) from article that justify it belonging to this category	
UT = Accession Number	
case = identity of the original article (Baumeister, Strack, Sripada, Caruso, Carter)	
timePeriod = whether article was published before or after the replication study in this case was published

# Dataset 4: d_coauthors

Description: This dataset contains all articles (co)authored by one of the first authors of the five original articles (Baumeister, Strack, Sripada, Caruso, Carter) as of 2nd February, 2021. The dataset has one row per article.

Source: This information was downloaded from Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection author records accessed via the University of Amsterdam on 2nd February, 2021.

Column:

Most columns are from the Web of Science bibliographic records and are self-explanatory.
